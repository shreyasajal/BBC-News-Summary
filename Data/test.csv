314,"blair dismisses quit claim report

tony blair has dismissed reports he told gordon brown he would quit before the next general election.

""you don't do deals over jobs like this,"" the prime minister told bbc one's breakfast with frost programme. according to a new book, brown's britain, mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june 2004. mr blair said the claims were ""reheated from six months ago"" and that he was concentrating on running the country. mr blair said: ""i've dealt with this six months ago. i said then you don't do deals over jobs like this - you don't.

""what both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country."" the book, by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston and serialised in the newspaper, said the pair had ""mutual animosity and contempt"" for each other.

it claims tony blair felt by november 2003 he had lost voters' trust because of the iraq war and that he was no longer an asset to the labour party. and that at a dinner hosted by deputy prime minister john prescott he told mr brown of his intention to stand down. according to mr peston the prime minister said: ""help me to get through the year and i will then stand down."" but he then changed his mind in june 2004, following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, according to the book.

mr peston told bbc news: ""my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were. ""what the book says is there is now a pretty profound mutual mistrust, mutual animosity. ""i think in public you see this double-act pretending everything is alright, but in private i don't think the relationship is good because brown, understandably, feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership."" but, in a wide-ranging bbc interview covering issues such as the asian tsunami disaster, the middle east peace process and northern ireland, mr blair said: ""when you get to the top in politics you get this huge swell around you. ""all sorts of people make all sorts of claims and counter-claims."" he admitted to a ""sense of frustration"" about the allegations which he said had been made ""countless times"".

there has been fresh speculation of a rift recently, following their separate responses to the asian tsunami. these rumours were fuelled by mr blair's decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new ""marshall plan"" for africa. there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other's response to the disaster. but the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a ""load of nonsense"". former welfare minister frank field mp said the prime minister should sack mr brown, but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so.

tory leader michael howard accused the prime minister and mr brown of ""squabbling like schoolboys"". he told sky news' sunday with adam boulton: ""this is the politics of the playground and britain really does deserve better."" the liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said the personal ambition of mr blair and mr brown was ""getting in the way of good government"". ""either they need to grow up and put their squabbles to one side or they cannot expect the electorate to support a divided government at the next election."" during the interview mr blair also said the former home secretary david blunkett would play a ""big role"" at the general election.

1310,"web helps collect aid donations

the web is helping aid agencies gather resources to help cope with the aftermath of the tsunami disaster.

many people are making donations via websites or going online to see how they can get involved with aid efforts. high-profile web portals such as google, yahoo, ebay and amazon are gathering links that lead people to aid and relief organisations. so many were visiting some aid-related sites that some webpages were struggling to cope with the traffic. an umbrella organisation called the disasters emergency committee (dec) has been set up by a coalition of 12 charities and has been taking many donations via its specially created website. it urged people to go online where possible to help because donations could be processed more quickly than cash donated in other ways, meaning aid could be delivered as quickly as possible. the site has so far received almost â£8 million, with more than 11,000 donations being made online every hour.

telco bt stepped in to take over the secure payments on the dec site and provided extra logistical support for phone and online appeals after it was initially crippled with online donations. it has also provided space in london's bt tower for one of the call centres dealing with donations.

some of the web's biggest firms are also helping to channel help by modifying their homepages to include links to aid agencies and organisations collecting resources. on its famously sparse homepage google has placed a link that leads users to a list of sites where donations can be made. among the 17 organisations listed are oxfam, medecins sans frontieres (doctors without borders) and network for good. many of the sites that google lists are also taking online donations. online retailer amazon has put a large message on its start page that lets people donate money directly to the american red cross that will be used with relief efforts. auction site ebay is giving a list of sites that people can either donate directly to, divert a portion of their profits from anything they sell on ebay to the listed organisations or simply buy items that direct cash to those in the list. yahoo is proving links direct to charities for those that want to donate. the auction drop website is asking people to donate old digital cameras, computers and other gadgets they no longer want that can be auction to raise cash for the aid effort. sadly, the outpouring of goodwill has also encouraged some conmen to try to cash in. anti-fraud organisations are warning about e-mails that are starting to circulate which try to convince people to send money directly to them rather than make donations via aid agencies. those wanting to give cash were urged to use legitimate websites of charities and aid agencies.

152,"kennedy to make temple address

charles kennedy is set to address 2,000 people at a hindu temple as part of an appeal to ethnic minority voters.

the liberal democrat leader will visit the shri swaminarayan mandir temple in neasden, north west london. he will say labour ""can no longer lay exclusive claim to the votes of britain's ethnic minorities"". mr kennedy will also highlight the anger among people of ""all races"" over the iraq war and call for a ""balanced approach"" to tackling terrorism. saturday's speech comes days after the lib dems launched their ethnic minority mini-manifesto. mr kennedy is to tell the audience: ""many people in britain, of all races, cultures and religions, were angry about the way we were taken to war in iraq. ""and they saw the principled stand the liberal democrats took at the time.""

he will also say that the lib dems want to ""restore britain's reputation on the world stage"" by fighting international poverty and climate change, and protecting human rights. mr kennedy will say that a ""balanced approach"" to tackling terrorism would mean ""tough measures to make britain safe - but not at the expense of people's fundamental legal rights like has happened at belmarsh"". he will say it also means acting through the united nations on terrorism. mr kennedy held talks with tony blair on friday over government plans to hold terror suspects under house arrest. he said afterwards that the prime minister had offered some ""movement"" to address his concerns. the plans face trouble in the lords if conservative and lib dem opposition continues.

904,"reds sink 10-man magpies

titus bramble's own goal put liverpool on the comeback trail as injury-hit newcastle were well beaten at anfield.

patrick kluivert's close-range finish put newcastle ahead after 31 minutes, but they were pegged back as bramble headed in steven gerrard's corner. neil mellor gave liverpool the lead before half-time from milan baros' pass before the czech added a third after rounding shay given on the hour. newcastle then had lee bowyer sent off for two bookable offences. liverpool brought back luis garcia after a hamstring injury, while newcastle were forced to draft in kluivert after craig bellamy was a late withdrawal with a back injury sustained in the warm-up. and garcia should have crowned his return with a goal inside the opening minute when he took a pass from baros but shot wildly over the top from eight yards. olivier bernard was only inches away from giving newcastle the lead after 20 minutes, when he fired just wide from a free-kick 25 yards out. but souness's side did go ahead 11 minutes later in highly controversial circumstances.

kluivert looked suspiciously offside when kieron dyer set bowyer free, but the dutchman was then perfectly placed to score from six yards. the lead lasted three minutes, with liverpool back on terms as bramble headed gerrard's corner into his own net under pressure from sami hyypia. and liverpool were ahead after 37 minutes when baros slid a perfect pass into mellor's path for the youngster to slip a slide-rule finish into given's bottom corner. garcia's finishing was wayward, and he was wasteful again in first-half injury time, shooting tamely at given after good work by xabi alonso. any hopes of a newcastle recovery looked to be snuffed out on the hour when a brilliant turn and pass by harry kewell set baros free and he rounded given to score. jermaine jenas then missed a glorious chance to throw newcastle a lifeline, shooting over from just eight yards out from shola ameobi's cross. then bowyer, who had already been booked for a foul on alonso, was deservedly shown the red card by referee graham poll for a wild challenge on liverpool substitute florent sinama-pongolle.

431,"cole refuses to blame van persie

ashley cole has refused to blame robin van persie for leaving arsenal with no fully-fit strikers for the fa cup fifth round replay at sheffield united.

van persie is suspended alongside dennis bergkamp and jose antonio reyes after being sent off at southampton when arsenal had a numerical advantage. thierry henry is ruled out with an achilles tendon injury but cole said: ""no-one is putting the blame on robin.

2079,"us company admits benin bribery

a us defence and telecommunications company has agreed to pay $28.5m after admitting bribery in the west african state of benin.

the titan corporation was accused of funnelling more than $2m into the 2001 re-election campaign of president mathieu kerekou. at the time, titan was trying to get a higher price for a telecommunications project in benin. there is no suggestion that mr kerekou was himself aware of any wrongdoing. titan, a california-based company, pleaded guilty to falsifying its accounts and violating us anti-bribery laws. it agreed to pay $13m in criminal penalties, as well as $15.5m to settle a civil lawsuit brought by the us financial watchdog, the securities and exchange commission (sec).

the sec had accused titan of illegally paying $2.1m to an unnamed agent in benin claiming ties with president kerekou. some of the money was used to pay for t-shirts with campaign slogans on them ahead of the 2001 election. shortly after the poll, which mr kerekou won, benin officials agreed to quadruple titan's management fee. prosecuting attorney carol lam said: ""all us companies should take note that attempting to bribe foreign officials is criminal conduct and will be appropriately prosecuted."" the company says it no longer tolerates such practices. under the us foreign corrupt practices act, it is a crime for american firms to bribe foreign officials.

1561,"charity single for quake relief

singers including sir cliff richard and boy george are recording a charity single to help raise funds for victims of the asian tsunami.

they hope the song will raise more than â£2m for the relief fund. the song, titled grief never grows old and described as a melancholy ballad, was written by radio dj mike read. former boyzone singer ronan keating may also take part if a studio can be found close to where he is holidaying in switzerland. other music stars being approached include robin and barry gibb of the bee gees, jazz sensation jamie cullum, chris rea and olivia newton-john.

sir cliff has recorded his vocal part in barbados, while boy george has recorded his in new york. read wrote the song before the boxing day tragedy but had thought it was too gloomy to release. now he plans to have it recorded by a collection of pop stars under the name one world project. ""it's a natural home for it because people kept saying to me, 'it's such a good song', but it's such a sad song,"" read said.

he said the song was a slow ballad and would work with around 10 singers, rather than a ""sing-along"" like the band aid 20 single raising money for famine relief in africa. the backing track has already been recorded and organisers hope it can be finished within the next week to get it into record shops as soon as possible. read went to the disasters emergency committee (dec), which is co-ordinating the british relief effort, with the idea the day after boxing day. ""i was totally shocked at the enormity and suddenness of the disaster and in tears on seeing the orphaned children wandering aimlessly in search of their parents,"" he said. read said all the funds raised by the record would go to the dec. ""i'd only be pleased in terms of what it meant for sales if it got to number one,"" he added. the charity welcomed the news of the single and said money raised would help its agencies working in the affected region to rebuild survivors' lives and livelihoods.

1862,"giving financial gifts to children

your child or grandchild may want the latest toy this christmas, but how about giving them a present that will help their financial future?

gifts of the financial variety might have a longer lasting impact. it may encourage children to save or start a fund which could count towards university costs, for example.

the government is trying to encourage saving at an early age, through its new child trust fund. the first vouchers, worth â£250 or â£500 for low-income families, will be distributed from january. all children born after 1st september 2002 will be eligible. parents will need to decide which financial institution will manage this gift in time for the start of the scheme in april 2005.

parents and relatives will be able to top up the fund with up to â£1,200 a year, which will grow free of income and capital gains tax. as the child trust fund will not be in force in time for christmas, relatives could invest their gifts in a higher rate children's deposit account, and use this as a feeder fund.

there are accounts designed to start children off in the savings habit and they often pay a higher rate of interest. some of the best instant-access accounts currently available include the ladybird account from the saffron walden building society, paying 5.35% for a minimum balance of â£1 and the alliance & leicester firstsaver which pays 5.25%, also starting at â£1.

interest earned by children is subject to income tax. however, children, like adults, have a personal income tax allowance (â£4,745 for the current tax year).

if the account holds money gifted by friends and relatives - but not parents - any interest earned from the savings account may be set against the allowance. as long as the total amount of interest falls within the allowance, then no tax will be payable. when the account is opened a form ""r85"", available from the bank or building society, should be completed. this confirms that the account holder is a non-taxpayer and allows interest to be received without the deduction of income tax.

the tax rules are different for parents who save on behalf of a child. only â£100 of interest (per parent) can be tax-free. where interest exceeds this level, the whole of the interest will be taxed on the parent. this is to prevent parents from holding their own cash savings in their children's names and taking advantage of the tax allowances. where both parents and other relatives are saving on behalf of a child, consideration should be given to opening separate accounts - one for parents' gifts and one for gifts from other relatives. therefore, it may be preferable for parents to contribute to the child trust fund which is tax free, with any gifts from relatives that take the total above the annual â£1,200 limit being directed to a deposit account.

another favourite solution is premium bonds. with the promise of riches far greater than a mere deposit account, they make great presents. the parent or guardian will be responsible for the bonds and will receive notification of the purchase. any prizes will be sent to the parent or child's guardian. the minimum for each purchase is â£100 and bonds are sold in multiples of â£10.

there are gift opportunities beyond cash accounts and these should not be ignored.

over the longer term, stock market funds have outperformed other types of investment, although in the shorter term they can be volatile. one of the benefits of investing for children is that investment is generally for the longer term - more than ten years - which helps to reduce the risks associated with investing in shares. one way to spread the risk is to invest in the stock market through a unit or investment trust. these are pooled investment funds which give access to a wide range of shares. these funds may be actively managed, where a fund manager picks individual stocks based on a view of their future potential, or passive, where a manager invests in all the shares that comprise a stock market index, for example, the ftse 100. exchange traded funds offer an alternative way to track a stock market. these are single shares that give the return of an underlying index (so are really another form of tracker). the difference is that the charges are quite low. the only drawback with all financial gifts is that the children gain an absolute right to the money at age 18, and parents will have no control over how it is spent. for larger gifts it may be worthwhile taking professional advice on the establishment of a suitable trust that will allow ongoing control over the capital and income.

demonstrators took to the streets last week when the cost change was first announced, but police seemed to have restored order. according to local press reports, trouble flared up again on saturday and carried on into sunday. el watan said that a number of hot spots centred on the villages and towns close to bouira, about 100 kilometres (60 miles) south of the capital algiers. among the other main areas affected were the western tiaret region and sidi ammar in the east of the country, agence france presse (afp) reported. riots also flared up in the maghnia region close to the border with morocco in the west, afp said. butane gas and fuel oil are used as the main source of fuel to heat homes and cook food in algeria's remote mountain areas.

archbishop desmond tutu has called for the release of the remaining inmates at guantanamo bay and terror suspects detained without trial in the uk.

his comments follow news that all four britons held by the us in the cuban camp will be freed within weeks. the south african archbishop said detentions without trial were ""unacceptable"" and ""distressing"". twelve foreign nationals are being held indefinitely without trial in the uk under anti-terror laws. referring to the detentions in cuba, archbishop tutu told bbc news: ""it is utterly unacceptable.

moazzam begg, from birmingham, and martin mubanga, richard belmar and feroz abbasi, from london, have been held by the us at guantanamo bay for almost three years. on tuesday foreign secretary jack straw told the commons that the us had agreed to release the four after ""intensive and complex discussions"" over security. the britons were detained as part of the us-led ""war on terror"". the archbishop added: ""whilst we are saying thank you that these have been released, what is happening to those left behind? ""we in south africa used to have a dispensation that detained people without trial and the world quite rightly condemned that as unacceptable.

""now if it was unacceptable then how come it can be acceptable to britain and the united states. it is so, so deeply distressing."" following mr straw's announcement, lawyer louise christian, who represents mr abbasi and mr mubanga, said the government should have acted sooner. foreign nationals detained in the uk are being held at belmarsh and woodhill prisons. in december the house of lords, the uk's highest court, ruled that the anti-terror measures broke human rights laws. but the men are still behind bars.

archbishop tutu criticised the measures, saying: ""i am opposed to any arbitrary detention that is happening, even in britain."" shami chakrabarti, director of civil rights group liberty, has called on the government to ""practise what it preaches"" and either free or charge the detained men. but the home office defended the measures. a spokesman said: ""these individuals cannot currently be prosecuted because some evidence, such as that provided by third parties, cannot safely be disclosed in criminal proceedings without putting others at risk. ""it is also currently the case that intelligence gained from covert intercepts cannot be used in a court of law.""

590,"rusedski angry over supplements

greg rusedski has criticised the governing body of men's tennis for not releasing contamination-free supplements in time for the new season.

rusedski said: ""i tried to order some but didn't receive any and i haven't got any yet. ""you would think they would have been available in december as it can take two months for the body to respond. ""this event comes in the hottest period of the year, so you would hope the stuff would be available for it."" the british number two escaped a possible ban last year when he persuaded a tribunal that a positive doping test was the result of contaminated atp supplements. in response, the atp struck a deal with pharmaceutical company glaxosmithkline to provide contamination-free drinks and nutritional bars for the men's tour.

david higdon, vice president of the atp, admitted: ""i agree with greg. ""i would have loved to have had these things available as soon as possible but it's a lot of work to make sure they have gone through rigorous testing. ""the reality is though that the first two weeks of the tour are spread far and wide and part of the distribution agreement we had with gsk has an education component. ""we weren't going to just drop these products out there without having a talk with the players about understanding how to use them.

""the first chance we will get to do that is at the players meeting on the saturday before the australian open."" and rusedski, who takes on roger federer at the qatar open later on wednesday, conceded that the imminent changes will be beneficial. ""the good thing is that there is now a 100% guarantee, so hopefully all this will never happen again,"" said rusedski. ""hopefully after the australian open we won't have to discuss this any more.""

2098,"bmw cash to fuel mini production

less than four years after the new mini was launched, german car maker bmw has announced â£100m of new investment.

some 200 new jobs are to be created at the oxford factory, including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building. the result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200,000 cars from 2007. the rise, from 189,000 last year, is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. before wednesday's announcement, bmw had invested some â£280m in mini production.

since its launch during summer 2001, the new mini has gone from strength to strength.

last year, almost one in six cars sold by the bmw group was a mini. the company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry. ""our decision to produce a new mini was not received well right away,"" said norbert reithofer, a member of the bmw management board. initially, bmw said it would produce 100,000 mini models a year at its vast cowley factory on the outskirts of oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again. not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue. ""the risk is that after they've invested massively in the brand, demand tapers off like it did with the new vw beetle,"" said brad wernle, from automotive news europe.

the price of the car has also gone up. when it was launched, the cheapest mini cost just more than â£10,000. these days, buyers will have to fork out almost â£11,500 to own a new mini one, or even more for the cooper s which costs up to â£17,730. the mini convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to â£15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list. second-hand minis are not cheap either. a mini one bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least â£8,000 for the cheapest model, while a used cooper s is likely to be priced from â£12,556, according to the-car buying website parker's. the consumers' association which operates with slightly different numbers, yet it confirms that the mini cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car, other than the mercedes benz c180 se and the bmw 1 series 116i se.

the cowley factory, which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100,000 minis, is increasingly being put to good use.

there are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. bmw's mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the uk car maker rover which it sold for â£10 five years ago to the phoenix consortium. in 1999, when bmw still owned rover, the oxford factory was producing the award-winning rover 75. during that year, 3,500 people produced 56,000 cars. last year, in the same factory, almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4,500 mini-workers. the mini factory's current output is equally impressive when compared with the main rover factory in longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 rover cars. last year, mg rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with shanghai automotive industry corporation (saic) that could help double the number of cars produced at longbridge. indeed, mini is not only producing more cars than mg rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of land rovers and range rovers (which are made by the former rover unit that bmw sold to ford) are taken into account.

64,"baa support ahead of court battle

uk airport operator baa has reiterated its support for the government's aviation expansion plans to airports throughout the country.

the comments come a day ahead of a high court challenge by residents' groups and local councils to the government's white paper. the judicial review will centre on government plans for expansion at heathrow, stansted and luton airports. baa, which operates all three, said it was consulting with local communities. ""we are...consulting on voluntary compensation schemes which go beyond our statutory obligations,"" a baa spokesman said.

groups challenging the plans include stop stansted expansion, heathrow anti-noise campaigners hacan clearskies and the london boroughs of hillingdon and wandsworth. at heathrow, gatwick, edinburgh and glasgow airports, baa launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in september 2004, which will close next week. the company is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. among other measures, baa has set up a homeowner support scheme for people living near stansted, and has launched a special scheme for those close to the airport but far enough away not to be covered by the homeowner scheme. at heathrow, baa said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met.

at gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. stop stansted expansion said the white paper, published in december 2003, was ""fundamentally flawed"" and did not follow the proper consultation process. ""we do not underestimate the scale of the challenge before us because the courts have never before overturned a government white paper,"" said stop stansted expansion chairman peter sanders said. hacan chairman john stewart said: ""almost exactly a year ago the government published its 30-year aviation white paper with much fanfare. ""it hoped that would be the end of the debate and it could proceed with its plans for a massive expansion of aviation. ""yet, a year later the protesters are still here, and stronger than ever. "" a judgement from mr justice sullivan is expected early in february.

2164,"eu-us seeking deal on air dispute

the eu and us have agreed to begin talks on ending subsidies given to aircraft makers, eu trade commissioner peter mandelson has announced.

both sides hope to reach a negotiated deal over state aid received by european aircraft maker airbus and its us rival boeing, mr mandelson said. airbus and boeing accuse each other of benefiting from illegal subsidies. mr mandelson said the eu and us hoped to avoid having to resolve the dispute at the world trade organisation (wto).

""with this agreement the eu and us have confirmed their willingness to resolve the dispute which has arisen between them,"" mr mandelson said. ""i hope our negotiations in the next three months will lead to an agreement ending subsidies to development and production of large civil aircraft."" last year, the us terminated an agreement with the eu, reached in 1992, which limits the subsidies countries can hand over to civil aircraft makers. the us filed a complaint against brussels with the wto over state aid to airbus, prompting a retaliatory eu complaint over us support for boeing. however, both sides agreed to suspend their requests for wto arbitration at the beginning of december, to allow bilateral talks to continue. eads and bae systems, the european defence and aerospace firms which own airbus, welcomed mr mandelson's announcement. ""it has always been preferable that any differences between the us and europe on this matter be overcome through constructive discussion rather than through legal recourse,"" the companies said in a joint statement.

separately, the world's largest package delivery company, ups, said it had placed an order for 10 airbus a380 superjumbo freight-carrying jets, with an option to buy 10 more of the triple-decker aircraft. the us company said it needed to expand its air freight capacity following strong international growth, and would begin receiving deliveries of the a380s from 2009. however, ups said it was cutting a previous order for smaller airbus a300s from 90 planes to 53. so far, airbus has delivered 40 a300s to ups. airbus overtook boeing as the world's largest manufacturer of commercial airliners in 2003.

i'm speechless. best song of the last 25 years? yeah right.

i very much doubt that 'angels' was even the best song of the week that it came out. like every track robbie has released as a single, it's a blatant but poor facsimile of something that someone else has done better before.

give us a break...!!!

best song in 25 years, you must be joking. its good if you like that sort of thing, but really!

listened to angels on radio 1 this morning when i was driving into work. had not heard it for a while. i love robs voice, the lyrics and tune. perfection!

as usual, the public have short memories when it comes to voting for ""the greatest"". there must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more. it's not exactly groundbreaking. presumably, the age range that could be bothered to vote is is pretty low...

i'm actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years!!

what about the specials - ghost town, the buzzcocks - ever fallen in love with someone... happy mondays - kinky afro, mcalmont & butler - yes, joy division - love will tear us apart... angels is middle-of-the-road rubbish.

angels is a awful piece of sentimental claptrap. it's musically and lyrically inept; and fantastically overrated, a bit like mr williams himself. this result isn't very surprising though, the brits has a long history of celebrating rubbish music!

best of the last 25 years? maybe. cunning to make the timescale not include stairway to heaven or bohemian rhapsody, but it does kind of make it a bit of a hollow award really. not much competition in the last 25 years after all.

it's alright for a pop song - but the best song of the last 25 years???

there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years....it's a travesty.

rubbish! who voted it for it to be included in any list? i am a regular listener to radio 2 but i don't recall the invitation to vote for this bland, slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn't know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last 25 years. how depressing and just when we thought manufactured 'pop' was on the way out - where on earth did this dreadful list appear from?

while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won, in all seriousness, i think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty. then again, well done robbie, good show.

you've got to be kidding.

angels is a great song, but not the best song of the last 25 years. only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits.

i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i don't think its the best song from the past 25 years! right enough, it is better than some of the others in this catergory, for example, what was will young doing being nominated in the first place - he is alright but the song isn't that good! i'm happy for robbie himself though!

best song in the last 25 years? what a joke! think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels. phil collins doesn't deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote? angels is an overrated song, that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it. soppy rubbish at best. hopefully manufactured rubbish will die down soon, and let the real artists who worked hard for there glory receive awards.

so boringly obvious and typical of the bland nature of mainstream music in britain today, for me it's proof that music and democracy just don't mix. still, at least it wasn't will young...

oh it's all just a bit of fun. people take these awards too seriously! robbie has millions of loyal fans, while even non-fans know the words to angels. him winning obviously reflects who votes in these awards. personally i wanted will young to win, but that was not really due to his musical talent!

i hate the song, all it brings back is memories of school discos and no-one to slow-dance with!

i agree about angels. i never get fed up hearing it. whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up, smile and sing along (very badly, that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out). the song makes me calm and serene and happy. well done robbie.

i think that although robbie williams is a good performer, that angels isn't really that good a song. it certainly isn't anywhere near as good as love will tear us apart by joy division or wuthering heights by kate bush.

angels is a fantastic song. all credit to robbie williams and guy chambers. it's a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups.

robbie did in no way deserve that mantle. whenever we have these awards it is always 'artists' from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best...we forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example. they weren't cool at the time, but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think.

yes angels is the best song since the past 25 years, because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning.

i've always disliked angels intensely. i believe it to be symbolic of the general capacity of british pre-teens, teens and middle aged women to accept low quality/ low aspirational music as ""classic"" songwriting. it's 'orrible. it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who don't particularly like music all that much. folks without collections; folks who have never engaged in that madness one experiences when falling under the spell of pop music. angels adds nothing - it is merely an irritating distraction - a wasp that refuses to go away on a summer's afternoon picnic. what a dreadful result. if you voted for it - you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don't you - so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote. booo hisss

angels, best song? you are kidding, right? last five years i might be willing to accept, but 25, no way. did whoever voted for this actually have any music knowledge prior to, say, 1995? really quite insulting to the british music industry of the past quarter of a century.

no surprise about robbie williams considering the list. where on earth did the nominations list come from???? compiled by an eleven year-old girl perhaps?? i mean, will young? come on.

what a load of crap, best song in the last 25 years - i don't think so!! what about all the real artists out there over the last 25 years - the list is endless, but robbie williams doesn't even come close.

what a joke. that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word 'angels' where i thrash around, and scream ""no no no no no"" until someone tells me ""the radio's off"". why a half-baked cheesy ditty like angels, which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops (think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example, and by whom), should be voted the best song of the past 25 years, is beyond me. if this is the song against which all others are judged, then musicians may as well give up.

why do we reward mediocrity so highly in this country?? the initial list was very weak anyway, but angels the best song of the last 25 years!!!! i think not, i didn't realize radio 2 had so many listeners under the age of 10!!

people have such short memories! a great song yes, but the best of the last 25 years? not a chance. i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here.

the great british public at work again. it's a mediocre, sentimental and safe song. granted, it's not too bad, either. but can it stand up against anything by the smiths (in particular ""how soon is now?"") or anything from the stone roses' first album? nope.

no, because i'm not female and i'm not 10!

ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song. but it is no way the best song of the past 25 years! the shortlist wasn't great but him winning it is a joke!

predictable and laughable.

the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last 25 years. the british public are brainwashed by the corporate pulp that is presneted to them as cutting edge music and true talent is being sadly missed. whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie's repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years.

i am a huge robbie fan and love that song. but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs / music out there that influenced music today, unfortunately they were left out of the list.

have radio 2 listeners even heard of joy division? a band who, through two albums, have had a bigger impact on music, and continue to do so, over the last 25 years than robbie williams ever will.

no doubt about it. there's not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling. some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances, but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song.

it should have been joy division.those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song. i sincerely do not believe that in 25 years from now, the most influential artists will argue that robbie williams inspired their art in the way that the byrds, the beatles and nick drake have done for music today.

yes!! i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people. there were other great songs in the category... but somebody had to win! robbie was a deserved winner.

i am astounded that such a second-rate record has beaten such a line up of amazing songs! it's a terrible song, voted for by the masses who don't have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music.

the best song of the past 25 years? really? come on, this is surely a joke? no? i think i need a long lie down...

it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division. i suppose it's confirmed one thing - the british public are consistently dull :- &lt;(

no offence robbie, but pleeease! there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids. no one agrees with this and quite frankly it is an embarassment to the integrity of british music, and a further nail in the coffin!

i think robbie deserves it, he has been the most iconic of any stars we have had in britain since john lennon and is an idol to millions worldwide. anybody who says he doesn't deserve it is jealous of his success. the only real challenger was queen but hey, another one bites the dust!!

obviously all the karaoke singers in the uk voted for it.

if this is the best song of the last 25 years then the british music industry is in trouble. sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material, but this is not the best record.

a sad day for music

it's not the type of music i normally like, but even as a diehard rock fan, i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people. that's why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years. it's a good all-rounder. just like robbie.

best song in 25 years? since 1980? i'm confused. ""angels"" isn't a bad song. it's a nice, catchy, formulaic anthem that ticks all the boxes. but this is not great music. if anything it's regressive. bland even. i suppose it's just more evidence of how redundant the brit awards have become.

granted angels is a good song, however it really wasn't up against any other proper competition. the queen's song was lackluster, and apart from kate bush, the other choices were pathetic! also, why weren't the stones there, david bowie, etc, there are so many greater songs than angels...i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasn't getting more awards so they had to make one up for him!

best song of the last 25 years? what a ridiculuous concept, and an even more ridiculous winner. sigh. on the upside, at least it wasn't bohemian rhapsody, for which we should all be thankful.

angels is without doubt a great song but i really don't think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies' goodlooks than the actual song!!! don't get me wrong, i'm not disputing his looks, but there are more deserved winners.

it would have been a travesty had angels not won. without angels, robbie williams may well not be where he is now, and britain would have been deprived of one of its most charismatic and talented performing artists. it has to be seen performed live, with 125,000 people singing along to be fully appreciated. well done rob.

i find it hard to believe that 'angels' is the best we have to show for the past 25 years! i'm rapidly redifining 'best' in my own head now to mean 'most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning'. what about britpop? blur, oasis, suede, pulp... not only making fantastic songs but also making changes, doing something different. why must 'best' always come down to most commercially popular?

i've nothing against robbie, i actually like his music, but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year? the brits has proved to be nothing more than a bargaining tool between the pop moguls to boost band profiles and record sales. the same goes with the scissor sisters, i think this is a superb record and thoroughly deserves the newcomer award, but the album comes no where near u2's new record, neither are they in the same league. once again there have been some baffling discisions made, they are not for artisic reasons, but for profit.

no surprise really, it's voted for by the general public. since when did they have taste in music?

personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard!

it absolutely deserved to win. it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come.

it's an absolute joke, however most of the original 25 were very poor choices as well. all in all a pretty pointless exercise !

the song is overplayed and oversentimental. out of the rather poor five choices that were left, it should have gone to either joy division or queen. i suppose we should be thankful that it didn't end up in the hands of will young though.

although it has nostalgia value, there is no way it deserved to win. everybody knows the words to bohemian rhapsody, nothing compares 2 u, etc. much better songs and more timeless. give it to someone with real talent.

although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years. this is just another example of record company manipulation to keep an artist in the public eye. why not give him an award for the greatest pair of trousers if that's all it means!
","angels is a great song, but not the best song of the last 25 years.whilst angels is a popular song it is not even the best song in robbie's repertoire never mind best song of the last 25 years.best song of the last 25 years?best song in the last 25 years?i think angels is a great song and deserved to be in the run up for this award but i don't think its the best song from the past 25 years!robbie williams' angels was named the best song of the past 25 years.it's alright for a pop song - but the best song of the last 25 years???best song in 25 years?although angels is a good song i think that anyone with the slightest musical taste will realise that this is not the best song of the last 25 years.a great song yes, but the best of the last 25 years?that's why it has been voted best song of the last 25 years.angels is without doubt a great song but i really don't think it deserves the title of best song in 25 years.perhaps the vote had more to do with teenage opinion on robbies' goodlooks than the actual song!!!the best song of the past 25 years?i've nothing against robbie, i actually like his music, but how can this possibly be the best song from the last 25year?if this is the best song of the last 25 years then the british music industry is in trouble.the initial list was very weak anyway, but angels the best song of the last 25 years!!!!but it is no way the best song of the past 25 years!i'm actually embarrassed to be british if that is the best song we have produced in the last 25 years!!booo hisss  angels, best song?i very much doubt that 'angels' was even the best song of the week that it came out.what a load of crap, best song in the last 25 years - i don't think so!!while i am biassed in that i thought love will tear us apart should have won, in all seriousness, i think that the best song of the last 25 years should not include songs less than 5 years old as that would exclude songs which are popular because of novelty.best song in 25 years, you must be joking.only the best song to be up for nomination at the brits.why a half-baked cheesy ditty like angels, which has become the anthem for millions of romantic sops (think how many times it was sung on pop idol for example, and by whom), should be voted the best song of the past 25 years, is beyond me.i am a regular listener to radio 2 but i don't recall the invitation to vote for this bland, slushy rubbish which might appeal to the masses who wouldn't know a good song if it jumped up and bit them on the nose but is certainly not the best song of the last 25 years.there is no way on earth that song should have been voted the best of the last 25 years....it's a travesty.ok i like robbie and angels is a decent song.i think that although robbie williams is a good performer, that angels isn't really that good a song.angels is a fantastic song.yes angels is the best song since the past 25 years, because it touches the soul as it carries a lot of meaning.""angels"" isn't a bad song.personally i find angels by robbie williams to be one of the most irritating songs i have ever heard!best of the last 25 years?i am a huge robbie fan and love that song.think of all the great rock and pop songs released in the 80s and pretty much all of them are better than angels.there must be more than a dozen songs in the last 25 years that deserve this award more.i think the person as opposed to the song has been voted for here.there must be a thousand better songs than a formulated cheesy pop song for kids.williams' track beat songs by will young, queen, kate bush and joy division in a vote by bbc radio 2 listeners to mark 25 years of the uk music industry ceremony.but i think there are a lot more outstanding songs / music out there that influenced music today, unfortunately they were left out of the list.a sad day for music  it's not the type of music i normally like, but even as a diehard rock fan, i recognise that it is a good song and appelas to most people.angels is an overrated song, that got tiresome even before you had finished listening to it.the success of angels at this years brits reflects poorly on the state of british music over the last 25 years.it is a song that has united the generations and will continue to be played for many years to come.mcfly won the best pop act prize, and gwen stefani picked up the best international female artist award.i find it hard to believe that 'angels' is the best we have to show for the past 25 years!the flamboyant act scored a hat-trick in the international categories, winning the best group, best album and best newcomer awards.what about all the real artists out there over the last 25 years - the list is endless, but robbie williams doesn't even come close.it should have been joy division.those guys have played an influential part in shaping modern day music while angels remains yet another pop song.it's a terrible song, voted for by the masses who don't have the brains to appreciate innovative and exciting music.little britain comedy duo matt lucas and david walliams presented the best song prize to robbie williams dressed as his former take that colleagues gary barlow and howard donald, leading him to quip he was ""always the talented man of the band"".some people will adopt their slightly snobby stances, but angels has hit home with a far larger audience than any other song.the song is overplayed and oversentimental.granted angels is a good song, however it really wasn't up against any other proper competition.right enough, it is better than some of the others in this catergory, for example, what was will young doing being nominated in the first place - he is alright but the song isn't that good!there were other great songs in the category... but somebody had to win!much better songs and more timeless.phil collins doesn't deserve awards for all the good songs he wrote?also, why weren't the stones there, david bowie, etc, there are so many greater songs than angels...i wonder if it was simply the fact that robbie wasn't getting more awards so they had to make one up for him!the us band, who opened the show with take your mama, won the best international act and newcomer awards, as well as best international album.franz ferdinand, who were shortlisted in five categories, won best rock act and best british group, an award they dedicated to late dj john peel.it's a mediocre, sentimental and safe song.keane won best british album and breakthrough act.if this is the song against which all others are judged, then musicians may as well give up.natasha bedingfield - in the running for best british female and best pop act - performed with her brother daniel for the first time at wednesday's event.a band who, through two albums, have had a bigger impact on music, and continue to do so, over the last 25 years than robbie williams ever will.soppy rubbish at best.it just goes to show that the british public do not have a clue about good quality music when they pick robbie williams over the beautifully talented kate bush and joy division.that song has become such a bane to me that i have developed a pavlovian response to the word 'angels' where i thrash around, and scream ""no no no no no"" until someone tells me ""the radio's off"".it seems obvious to me that people who like robbie are people who don't particularly like music all that much.the song makes me calm and serene and happy.the queen's song was lackluster, and apart from kate bush, the other choices were pathetic!will young won the best single prize for your game.robbie has millions of loyal fans, while even non-fans know the words to angels.if you voted for it - you should feel ashamed of yourself - you probably only know a dozen songs or so don't you - so where do get off applying this uninformed filter and casting this ridiculous vote.i think its a brilliantly written song with different meanings to different people.viewers of digital music tv channel mtv base voted stone the winner in the best urban act category.i'm rapidly redifining 'best' in my own head now to mean 'most gratuitously played at weddings and funerals because people think it has deep meaning'.there's not a song done by anyone with more emotion and feeling.sure robbie is talented and produces excellent material, but this is not the best record.it's a song that will be played forever and bridges all age groups.they weren't cool at the time, but because they are cool again now shows that the songs have greater longevity than people think.robbie was a deserved winner.why must 'best' always come down to most commercially popular?just like robbie.after beating amy winehouse, jamelia, natasha bedingfield and pj harvey to the best british female prize, joss stone said: ""i don't know what to say.glasgow group franz ferdinand won two prizes, as did keane and joss stone, who was voted best urban act by digital tv viewers.best british male artist winner mike skinner - aka the streets - does not usually attend award ceremonies, but the birmingham hip-hop artist performed his hit dry your eyes at the ceremony.whenever the song comes on the radio i turn the radio up, smile and sing along (very badly, that is why the radio has to be turned up to drown my voice out).then again, well done robbie, good show.but they missed out on best british live act, which went to muse.whenever we have these awards it is always 'artists' from the past five years that seem to win the best of the best...we forget about the late 80s and early 90s for example.",entertainment,3482,1706

the british phonographic industry (bpi) had planned to include download formats in the chart from 20 march. but the date has been put back to 17 april to create a ""level playing field"" for independent labels. the bpi is concerned that independent repertoire is not adequately represented online and said they were looking at ways of rectifying it.

620,"nadal puts spain 2-0 up

result: nadal 6-7 (6/8) 6-2 7-6 (8/6) 6-2 roddick

spain's rafael nadal beats andy roddick of the usa in the second singles match rubber of the 2004 davis cup final in seville. spain lead 1-0 after carlos moya beat mardy fish in straight sets in the opening match of the tie.

nadal holds his nerve and the crowd goes wild as spain go 2-0 up in the tie.

roddick holds serve to force nadal to serve for the match but the american surely cannot turn things around now.

nadal works roddick around the court on two consecutive points to earn two break points. one is enough, the spaniard secures the double-break and roddick is now teetering on the edge.

roddick is trying to gee himself up but the clay surface is taking its toll on his game and he is looking tired. nadal wins the game to love.

nadal steps up the pressure to break and spain have the early initiative in the fourth set.

nadal also holds convincingly as both players feel their way into the fourth set.

roddick shrugs off the disappointment of losing the third-set tiebreak and breezes through his first service game of the fourth set.

nadal earns the first mini-break in the tiebreak as the match enters its fourth hour. a couple of stunning points follow, one where nadal chases down a roddick shot and turns into a passing winner. then roddick produces some amazing defence at the net to take the score to 4-4. roddick has two serves for the set but double-faults to take the score to 5-5. nadal saves a roddick set point then earns his own with a drive volley - and a crosscourt passing winner sends the crowd wild.

nadal tries to up his aggression and he passes roddick down the line to go 15-40 and two set points up. roddick saves the first with a desperate lunge volley and smacks a volley winner across the court to take the score back to deuce before securing the game. the set will go to another tiebreak.

nadal enjoys another straightforward hold and roddick must once again serve to stay in the set.

roddick again holds on, despite some brilliant shot-making from his opponent.

nadal races through his service game to put the pressure straight back onto roddick.

roddick hangs in on his serve to level matters but nadal is making him fight for every point.

nadal could be suffering a disappointment hangover from the previous game as he goes 0-30 down and then has to save a break point after a tremendous rally in which he is forced into some brilliant defence. but it pays off and the spaniard edges ahead in the set.

roddick's serve is not firing as ferociously as usual and has to rely on his sheer competitive determination to stay in the set. three times, nadal forces a break point and three times the world number two hangs in. and roddick's grit pays off as he manages to hold.

roddick still looks a bit sluggish but he attacks the net and is rewarded with a break point, which nadal saves with a good first serve and the spaniard goes on to hold.

there is a disruption in play as roddick is upset about something in the crowd. the spanish captain gets involved as does the match referee but it is unclear what the problem is. one thing for certain is that the crowd are roused into support of nadal and they go wild when roddick loses the next point and goes break point down. roddick saves the break point and then bangs down his ninth ace before clinching the game with a service winner.

the game passes the two-hour mark as nadal holds serve to edge ahead in the third set.

now roddick has to defend a break point and he produces a characteristic ace to save it. it is immediately followed by another and he holds with a little dinked half-volley winner.

roddick is looking a little leaden-footed but does carve out a break point for himself. but he plays it poorly and nadal avoids the danger.

roddick has gone off the boil and again struggles. he fails to get down properly for a low forehand volley and gives nadal three break points. the american blasts an ace to save one but follows up with a double fault and the rubber is level.

nadal edges towards taking the second set with a comfortable hold.

two good serves put roddick 30-0 up but he then makes a couple of errors to find himself 30-40 down. he saves the break point with an ace and then manages to hold.

roddick's level has dropped while nadal is on a hot streak. the spaniard includes a superb crosscourt winner off the back foot as he races through his service game without dropping a point.

roddick double-faults twice and nadal takes full advantage of the break point offered, powering a passing winner past roddick.

nadal wins another tight game. neither player has dipped from the high standard of play in the first set.

nadal puts the american under pressure and roddick saves a break point with a superb stop volley before going on to hold.

nadal puts the disappointment of losing the first-set tiebreak to claim the opening game in the second.

roddick double-faults to concede the first mini-break and then nadal loops a crosscourt winner to seize advantage in the tiebreak. he lets one slip but wins his next serve to earn three set points. but roddick saves them and then earns one himself. nadal comes up with a down-the-line winner but then nets tamely on roddick's next set point.

nadal's nerve is tested as he tries to force a tiebreak. both players come up with some scintillating tennis and the spaniard has several chances to clinch the game before finally doing so when roddick drives wide.

a pulsating game sees nadal racing round the court retrieving and refusing to give roddick any easy points. the point of the match so far involves roddick's slam-dunk smash being returned by nadal before roddick finally manages to end the rally. on the very next point, nadal blasts a forehand service return from right of court that passes roddick and even the american is forced to applaud. but roddick comes up with two big serves to polish off the game.

nadal outplays roddick to reach 40-0 but the american fights back to 40-30 before nadal's powerful crosscourt forehand winner secures the game.

the crowd are getting very involved, cheering between roddick's first and second serves. but the american comes through to hold and edge ahead in the set.

nadal manages to hold again despite roddick piling the pressure on his serve. the spaniard wins the game courtesy of another lucky net cord.

roddick double faults buts manages to keep his composure. a well-placed serve is unreturnable and roddick holds.

a powerful ace down the middle gives nadal a simple love service game - the first time he has held serve so far in the match. if roddick didn't know before, he knows now that he is in a real contest.

another superb game as nadal breaks to once again lift the roof. he produces some fine groundstrokes to leave roddick chasing shadows. four of the first five games have seen a break of serve.

despite the disappointment of losing his serve, roddick is not phased and storms into a 40-15 lead when the umpire leaves his seat to confirm a close line-call. nadal takes the next point but roddick breaks again with a sharp volley at the net.

roddick's advantage is short lived as nadal breaks back immediately. a fortunate net cord helps the spaniard on his way and when roddick fires a forehand cross court shot wide to lose his serve, nadal pumps his fist in celebration.

the american is pumped up for this clash and takes on nadal's serve from the start. nadal's drop shot is agonisingly called out and roddick claims the vital first break.

after moya's win in the opening rubber, a raucous seville crowd is buoyed by nadal's impressive start which sees him race into a 30-0 lead. however roddick fights back to hold his serve.

1491,"us box office set for record high

ticket sales at the us box office are predicted to break records this year, with figures expected to reach $9.4 billion, beating 2002's all-time high.

overall figures could be dampened by the lack of a christmas hit like last year's oscar-winning lord of the rings. traditionally, ticket sales during the festive season account for 20% of the annual total. although admissions have actually fallen this year, the predicted high is down to increasing ticket prices. according to exhibitor relations president paul dergarabedian, the average cost of a cinema ticket could be as high as $6.25 in 2004, compared to $5.80 in 2002. this year some of the biggest hits such as the passion of the christ and fahrenheit 9/11 came from outside the major studios which are usually responsible for the key blockbusters.

""many of the films that did well (with audiences) are not necessarily the films that made a lot of money,"" said mr dergarabedian. he added that surprise hits had come from some of the more art-house offerings such as napoleon dynamite and critical hit sideways. sony pictures, responsible for hits like spiderman 2 and the grudge, are expected to top domestic market share for the second time in three years, with $1 billion-plus in sales for the third consecutive year. sony pictures entertainment vice chairman. jeff blake said: ""we had a really diverse slate this year, and... certainly we pulled off one of the surprises with grudge."" horror movie the grudge cost sony $10 million to make but brought in $110 million. it's the latest in a recent trend for hollywood studios to back the upper and lower ends of the market, whilst ignoring the middle. warner inc are likely to end the year in second place on market share with around $1.25 billion, with disney at number three.

catalina sandino moreno has joined a rare group of actresses who have been nominated for an oscar for starring in a foreign language film.

the colombian-born actress was the final hope for director joshua marston, who scoured the us and colombia for a lead for maria full of grace. the film sees the 23-year-old play a teenage drug mule who smuggles heroin by swallowing pellets in condoms. plaudits have been raining down on her for her gritty performance, making it all the more surprising that this is her first film. her previous acting experience was in amateur productions in her home city of bogota at the ruben di pietro theatre academy. she has already received a nomination for the independent spirit awards leading actress category but these rarely overlap with academy awards, instead recognising quirkier, low-budget films. and at the 2004 berlin film festival the jury could not choose between her and charlize theron's oscar winning performance in monster so gave them a tied award. sandino moreno is now being regarded as one of the most promising actresses around at the moment. but she is taking her time committing to her next project, hoping to land a strong spanish script and would love to be able to work with directors pedro almodovar or alejandro amenabar.

the blues are poised to complain about an alleged half-time incident during wednesday's 2-1 loss at the nou camp. the source of chelsea's anger was an alleged talk between barca boss frank rijkaard and referee anders frisk, who later dismissed didier drogba. ""to react the way chelsea have is pathetic. mourinho lied with the line-ups, and now this,"" ten cate said. uefa has said its own tunnel representative witnessed nothing unusual out of the ordinary during the half-time break. spokesman william gaillard said: ""frisk says rijkaard greeted him and apologised he had not had the opportunity to say hello before the game. ""we had two uefa officials there and neither witnessed it. the referee's dressing room was locked and he and his assistants were the only people allowed in."" indeed, it is the londoners who could be on the receiving end of any punishment after failing to turn up for the compulsory press conference after the defeat.

uefa delegate thomas giordano added: ""the only unusual thing that happened as far as we are concerned is that chelsea failed to present themselves in the press conference."" the referee is not expected to include any of the alleged incidents in his report to uefa - weakening chelsea's case. rijkaard was critical of mourinho's decision not to speak to the media after the match. ""there was a lot of talking before the game and now surprisingly there is a lot of talking after the game. it is not good behaviour after a match,"" he said. ""maybe they want to start something and make it worse than than it is. i really don't understand it. i am very calm about it.""

barca midfielder deco, formerly managed by mourinho at porto, agreed that it was not typical of his fellow portuguese to lodge a protest.

1868,"japanese banking battle at an end

japan's sumitomo mitsui financial has withdrawn its takeover offer for rival bank ufj holdings, enabling the latter to merge with mitsubishi tokyo.

sumitomo bosses told counterparts at ufj of its decision on friday, clearing the way for it to conclude a 3 trillion yen ($29bn) deal with mitsubishi. the deal would create the world's biggest bank with assets of about 189 trillion yen ($1.8 trillion). sumitomo's exit ends the most high profile fight in japanese bank history.

ufj holdings, japan's fourth-largest bank, has been at the centre of a fierce bid battle over the last year. sumitomo, japan's third-largest bank, tabled a higher offer for ufj than its rival, valuing the company at $35bn.

466,"trial date is set for balco case

a us judge has set a preliminary trial date for the balco steroid distribution case which has rocked athletics.

us district court judge susan ilston rejected an attempt by the defence team to have the case dismissed at a pre-trial hearing in san francisco. and she set a march date for the case of the four men accused of distributing illegal performance-enhancing drugs to elite athletes to be heard. a firm decision on whether the trial takes place is expected in january. the judge said that she may conduct hearings in january into whether federal agents illegally searched the balco headquarters and wrongfully obtained statements from the company's founder victor conte and its vice-president james valente. the two men - along with personal trainer greg anderson and athletics coach remy korchemny - were all indicted earlier this year but have pleaded their innocence. the outcome of those hearings could result in some or all of the charges being dismissed. conte said that he would be telling his side of the story on an american tv show on friday.

""the world deserves to know the truth about performance-enhancing drugs,"" he said. balco (the bay area laboratory cooperative) is the company at the centre of the scandal. the company has been accused by the united states anti-doping agency (usada) of being the source of the banned steroid thg and modafinil. the usada claims that 10 athletes have received sanctions for testing positive for thg and modafinil. former double world champion kelli white and olympic relay star alvin harrison have both been banned on the basis of materials discovered during the balco investigation. britain's former european 100m champion dwain chambers is currently serving a two-year ban after testing positive for thg in an out-of-competition test in 2003.

1106,"rolling out next generation's net

the body that oversees how the net works, grows and evolves says it has coped well with its growth in the last 10 years, but it is just the start.

""in a sense, we have hardly started in reaching the whole population,"" the new chair of the internet engineering task force (ietf), brian carpenter, says. the ietf ensures the smooth running and organisation of the net's architecture. with broadband take-up growing, services like voice and tv will open up interesting challenges for the net. ""i think voip (voice-over internet protocol, allowing phone calls to be made over the net) is very important - it challenges all the old cost models of telecoms,"" says dr carpenter. ""second, it challenges more deeply the business model that you have to be a service provider with a lot of infrastructure. with voip, you need very little infrastructure.""

a distinguished ibm engineer, dr carpenter spent 20 years at cern, the european laboratory for particle physics. as the new chair of the ietf, his next big challenge is overseeing ipv6, the next generation standard for information transfer and routing across the web. at cern, dr carpenter helped pioneer advanced net applications during the development of the world wide web, so he is well-placed to take on such a task. the net's growth and evolution depend on standards and protocols, and ensuring the architecture works and talks to other standards is a crucial job of the ietf. the top priority is to ensure that the standards that make the net work, are open and free for anyone to use and work with.

the net is built on a protocol called tcp/ip, which means transmission control protocol, and internet protocol. when computers communicate with the net, a unique ip address is used to send and receive information. the ietf is a large international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers working on the evolution of the net's architecture and the way this information is sent and received. they make sure it all knits together leaving no gaps. ""we've seen some interesting effects over last few years,"" explains dr carpenter. ""the net was growing at a fantastic rate at the end of the 90s. then there was a bit of a glitch in 2000. ""we are now seeing a very clear phase of consolidation and renewed growth.""

that renewed growth is also being buoyed by emerging economies, like china, which are showing fast uptake of broadband net and other technologies. the number of broadband subscribers via dsl (digital subscriber line) doubled in a year to 13 million, according to figures released at the end of 2004. ""the challenges we face are about continuing to produce standards to allow for that growth rate,"" explained dr carpenter. ""given it [the net] was designed for the whole community, it has done well to reach millions. if you want to reach the whole population, you have to make sure it can scale up."" ipv6, the standard that will replace the existing ipv4, will allow for billions more addresses on the net, and it is gradually being worked into network infrastructure across the world. ""the actual number of addresses with ipv4 is limited to four billion ip addresses. ""that clearly is not enough when you have 10 billion people to serve, so there is technical solution, the new version of ip - ipv6. ""it has much larger address space possibilities with no practical limits,"" said dr carpenter. standards are vital to something as complex as the net, and making sure standards are open and can work with across networks is a big task. the difference this next generation standard, ipv6, will make to the average net user is almost invisible. ""our first goal is that it [ipv6] should make no difference - people should not notice a difference. ""it is like when the london telephone numbers got longer. a lot of the process will be invisible. ""people are usually given an ip address without knowing it."" technically deployment has started and the standards for are just about settled, said dr carpenter.

the one problem with the net that may never disappear completely is security. to dr carpenter, the solution comes out of technological and human behaviour. people have to be educated about ""sensible behaviour"" he says, such as ignoring e-mails that claim you have won something.

""i don't think it is going to get worse. people will remain concerned about security and they probably should do - just as you would be concerned walking along a dark street. ""we have to do work to make sure there are better security internet standards. it is a never-ending battle in a sense."" but, he adds: ""even if security has improved, you still worry a bit. unfortunately, it is just part of life. we have a duty to do what we can.""

1654,"bangkok film festival battles on

organisers of the third bangkok international film festival have been determined to carry on with this year's event despite the ravages of the asian tsunami disaster.

the festivities have been scaled down, red carpets have been mothballed and profits from ticket sales are being donated to the tsunami relief fund. apart from this, however, the festival has continued as originally planned. ""when the disaster happened, we naturally asked ourselves if we should cancel,"" said the festival's executive director, craig prater. ""the decision was made that we would continue, but that the focus would change.

""our premieres became fundraisers, the opening night was visibly toned down and 10% of every ticket sold goes to the disaster fund,"" he continued. ""but we feel like we've turned a page. we've acknowledged our position, and now it's business as usual.""

mr prater's sentiments were echoed by christine rush, director of the festival's sister event, the bangkok film market. ""we have been careful to be respectful of the thai nation's recovery from this terrible disaster,"" she said.

""however, the nation's recovery very much depends upon it continuing its economic life. ""we are encouraging attendees to keep the victims in mind and aggressively support the aid organisations helping out,"" she added. given the conspicuously low audience figures, that support may be more symbolic than significant. however, poor ticket sales have less to do with any fallout from the disaster and more to do with administrative and promotional difficulties.

the eclectic programme contains a wide range of titles, including such oscar hopefuls as ray charles biopic ray and mike leigh's abortion drama vera drake. that said, the absence of thai subtitles on most film prints might have proved offputting to local cinemagoers.

on a more positive note, the celebrity guests attending the event have generated huge media interest in this busy capital city. problems securing air transport, the clash with last sunday's golden globes ceremony in los angeles and other factors have forced some big names to cancel.

but the festival has still attracted such hollywood directors as oliver stone and joel schumacher, alongside such screen stars as michael douglas, jeremy irons and jean-claude van damme. irons, whose film being julia is in competition for the festival's golden kinnaree awards, said he had wondered whether he should attend after december's catastrophe. ""i questioned whether i should come when such a tragedy had happened,"" the british actor said. ""i thought it might be in rather bad taste. but then i spoke to the organisers and i was encouraged to let life go on. ""now i've come here i'm very glad. what impresses me about thai culture is they get over these things far quicker than we do in the west,"" he continued. ""basically i was invited here by thailand. if they still want you to come, you should.""

now in its third year, bangkok is a relatively recent addition to the hectic film festival calendar. and while it has yet to attain the stature of more established events held in hong kong, tokyo and pusan in south korea, mr prater predicts it will soon become their equal. ""it's grown awfully fast in three years - maybe too fast,"" he concedes. ""we've had some bumps in the road, but that's only because the festival is still a baby. ""i have no doubt in my mind that in five years, this will be the top asian film festival in the world."" the golden kinnarees will be awarded on friday. the festival itself runs until 24 january.

mtv has been criticised for ""incessant sleaze"" by television indecency campaigners in the us.

the parents television council (ptc), which monitors violence and sex on tv, said the cable music channel offered the ""cheapest form"" of programming. the group is at the forefront of a vociferous campaign to clean up american television. but a spokeswoman for mtv said it was ""unfair and inaccurate"" to single out mtv for criticism.

the ptc monitored mtv's output for 171 hours from 20 march to 27 march 2004, during the channel's spring break coverage. in its report - mtv smut peddlers: targeting kids with sex, drugs and alcohol - the ptc said it witnessed 3,056 flashes of nudity or sexual situations and 2,881 verbal references to sex. brent bozell, ptc president and conservative activist said: ""mtv is blatantly selling raunchy sex to kids. ""compared to broadcast television programmes aimed at adults, mtv's programming contains substantially more sex, foul language and violence - and mtv's shows are aimed at children as young as 12. ""there's no question that tv influences the attitudes and perceptions of young viewers, and mtv is deliberately marketing its raunch to millions of innocent children.""

the watchdog decided to look at mtv's programmes after janet jackson's infamous ""wardrobe malfunction"" at last year's super bowl. the breast-baring incident generated 500,000 complaints and cbs - which is owned by the same parent company as mtv - was quick to apologise. mtv spokeswoman jeannie kedas said the network follows the same standards as broadcasters and reflects the culture and what its viewers are interested in. ""it's unfair and inaccurate to paint mtv with that brush of irresponsibility,"" she said. ""we think it's underestimating young people's intellect and level of sophistication."" ms kedas also highlighted the fact mtv won an award in 2004 for the fight for your rights series that focused on issues such as sexual health and tolerance.

549,"can smith work scottish wonders?

the worst kept secret in scottish football was revealed on thursday when walter smith was named as the new national manager.

from the moment berti vogts' miserable tenure in charge of scotland ended, the former rangers and everton boss has been the overwhelming favourite for the post. but is smith the man for what must be one of the hardest jobs in football? the 56-year-old takes over at a time when the national side is in the doldrums. scotland have not reached a major finals since the world cup in 1998 and reaching germany 2006 looks near impossible, having picked up just two points from the opening three games in the qualifying race. and the fifa rankings see scotland listed at an all time low of 77th, below the likes of estonia, ghana, angola and thailand. scotland are not blessed with quality players with experience at the top level, so smith will have to get the best out of meagre resources. smith's track record make impressive reading and he is widely respected within the game. the man who was alex ferguson's assistant when scotland played at the 1986 world cup won seven league titles with rangers. and his appointment has been widely endorsed by many of the games' top names, including ferguson and graeme souness, who took him to ibrox as his assistant in 1986. characters like souness, ferguson and current ibrox manager alex mcleish all cite smith's experience and his expansive knowledge of the scottish game.

much was made of vogts' inability to express himself to the players and media. that will certainly not be the case with smith. the former dundee united and dumbarton full-back is from the managerial old school - straight talking and never slow to let players know when he expects better (often with the use of some colourful invective). but it should be remembered vogts came to scotland with an impressive curriculum vitae - a world cup winner as a player and a european championships winner as a manager. smith will inherit the same problems vogts had - a callow squad of players with no exceptional talents. and it remains to be seen if smith will experience the rash of call-offs that blighted so much of vogts' preparation work. a fresh start for the scottish national team was imperative and smith is widely regarded as a safe pair of hands. but will a safe pair of hands be enough when the adroit hands of a magician might be required...

a failed government scheme to offer uk university courses online has been branded a ""disgraceful waste"" by mps.

the e-university was scrapped last year, having attracted only 900 students at a cost of â£50m. chief executive john beaumont was paid a bonus of â£44,914, despite a failure to bring in private sector backers. the commons education select committee called this ""morally indefensible"" but the government said the e-university project had ""improved understanding"".

a department for education and skills spokeswoman said the venture had been ""ambitious and ground-breaking, but take-up had not been ""sufficient to continue with the project"". she added: ""uk e-universities was not the only organisation to have lost out on private sector investment in the collapse of the dotcom boom."" the select committee found that those responsible for founding the e-university in 2000 had been caught up in the ""general atmosphere of enthusiasm"" surrounding the internet. initial business plans forecast a quarter of a million students joining within a decade, bringing in at least â£110m in profit.

but virtually no market research was carried out and just â£4.2m was spent on worldwide sales and marketing of courses. some â£14m went on developing the technology to make the e-university work. this was used by just 200 students, the rest preferring to work through existing university websites. with no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister, the e-university had had ""too much freedom to spend public money as it wished"", the report found. committee chairman barry sheerman said: ""uk e-university was a terrible waste of public money.

1053,"mobile networks seek turbo boost

third-generation mobile (3g) networks need to get faster if they are to deliver fast internet surfing on the move and exciting new services.

that was one of the messages from the mobile industry at the 3gsm world congress in cannes last week. fast 3g networks are here but the focus has shifted to their evolution into a higher bandwidth service, says the global mobile suppliers association. at 3gsm, siemens showed off a system that transmits faster mobile data. the german company said data could be transmitted at one gigabit a second - up to 20 times faster than current 3g networks. the system is not available commercially yet, but motorola, the us mobile handset and infrastructure maker, held a clinic for mobile operators on hsdpa (high speed downlink packet access), a high-speed, high bandwidth technology available now. early hsdpa systems typically offer around two megabits per second (mbps) compared with less than 384 kilobits per second (kbps) on standard 3g networks.

""high-speed downlink packet access (hsdpa) - sometimes called super 3g - will be vital for profitable services like mobile internet browsing and mobile video clips,"" according to a report published by uk-based research consultancy analysys. a number of companies are developing the technology. nokia and canada-based wireless communication products company sierra wireless recently agreed to work together on high speed downlink packet access. the two companies aim to jointly market the hsdpa solution to global network operator customers.

""while hsdpa theoretically enables data rates up to a maximum of 14mbps, practical throughputs will be lower than this in wide-area networks,"" said dr alastair brydon, author of the analysys report: pushing beyond the limits of 3g with hsdpa and other enhancements. ""the typical average user rate in a real implementation is likely to be in the region of one megabit per second which, even at this lower rate, will more than double the capacity... when compared to basic wcdma [3g],"" he added. motorola has conducted five trials of its technology and says speeds of 2.9mbps have been recorded at the edge of an outdoor 3g cell using a single hsdpa device. but some mobile operators are opting for a technology called evolution, data optimised (ev-do).

us operator sprint ordered a broadband data upgrade to its 3g network at the end of last year. we are ""expanding our network and deploying ev-do technology to meet customer demand for faster wireless speeds,"" said oliver valente, sprint's vice president for technology development, when the contract was announced. as part of $3bn in multi-year contracts announced late last year, sprint will spend around $1bn on ev-do technology from lucent technologies, nortel networks and motorola that provides average data speeds of 0.3-0.5 megabits a second, and peak download rates of 2.4mbps. mmo2, the uk-based operator with services in the uk, ireland and germany, has opted for technology based on the high speed downlink packet access (hsdpa) standard. using technology from lucent, it will offer data speeds of 3.6mbps from next summer on its isle of man 3g network, and will eventually support speeds of up to 14.4mbps. us operator cingular wireless is also adopting hsdpa, using technology from lucent alongside equipment from siemens and ericsson.

siemens' plans for a one gigabit network may be more than a user needs today, but christoph caselitz, president of the mobile networks division at the firm says that: ""by the time the next generation of mobile communication debuts in 2015, the need for transmission capacities for voice, data, image and multimedia is conservatively anticipated to rise by a factor of 10."" siemens - in collaboration with the fraunhofer german-sino lab for mobile communications and the institute for applied radio system technology - has souped up mobile communications by using three transmitting and four receiving antennae, instead of the usual one. this enables a data transmission, such as sending a big file or video, to be broken up into different flows of data that can be sent simultaneously over one radio frequency band. the speeds offered by3g mobile seemed fast at the time mobile operators were paying huge sums for 3g licences. but today, instead of connecting to the internet by slow, dial-up phone connection, many people are used to broadband networks that offer speeds of 0.5 megabits a second - must faster than 3g. this means users are likely to find 3g disappointing unless the networks are souped up. if they aren't, those lucrative ""power users"", such as computer geeks and busy business people will avoid them for all but the most urgent tasks, reducing the potential revenues available to mobile operators. but one gigabit a second systems will not be available immediately. siemens says that though the system works in the laboratory, it still has to assess the mobility of multiple-antennae devices and conduct field trials. a commercial system could be as far away as 2012, though siemens did not rule out an earlier date.

1099,"kenyan school turns to handhelds

at the mbita point primary school in western kenya students click away at a handheld computer with a stylus.

they are doing exercises in their school textbooks which have been digitised. it is a pilot project run by eduvision, which is looking at ways to use low cost computer systems to get up-to-date information to students who are currently stuck with ancient textbooks. matthew herren from eduvision told the bbc programme go digital how the non-governmental organisation uses a combination of satellite radio and handheld computers called e-slates. ""the e-slates connect via a wireless connection to a base station in the school. this in turn is connected to a satellite radio receiver. the data is transmitted alongside audio signals."" the base station processes the information from the satellite transmission and turns it into a form that can be read by the handheld e-slates. ""it downloads from the satellite and every day processes the stream, sorts through content for the material destined for the users connected to it. it also stores this on its hard disc.""

the system is cheaper than installing and maintaining an internet connection and conventional computer network. but mr herren says there are both pros and cons to the project. ""it's very simple to set up, just a satellite antenna on the roof of the school, but it's also a one-way connection, so getting feedback or specific requests from end users is difficult.""

the project is still at the pilot stage and eduvision staff are on the ground to attend to teething problems with the linux-based system. ""the content is divided into visual information, textual information and questions. users can scroll through these sections independently of each other."" eduvision is planning to include audio and video files as the system develops and add more content. mr herren says this would vastly increase the opportunities available to the students. he is currently in negotiations to take advantage of a project being organised by search site google to digitise some of the world's largest university libraries. ""all books in the public domain, something like 15 million, could be put on the base stations as we manufacture them. then every rural school in africa would have access to the same libraries as the students in oxford and harvard"" currently the project is operating in an area where there is mains electricity. but mr herren says eduvision already has plans to extend it to more remote regions.

1004,"spam e-mails tempt net shoppers

computer users across the world continue to ignore security warnings about spam e-mails and are being lured into buying goods, a report suggests.

more than a quarter have bought software through spam e-mails and 24% have bought clothes or jewellery. as well as profiting from selling goods or services and driving advertising traffic, organised crime rings can use spam to glean personal information. the business software alliance (bsa) warned that people should ""stay alert"". ""many online consumers don't consider the true motives of spammers,"" said mike newton, a spokesperson for the bsa which commissioned the survey.

""by selling software that appears to be legitimate in genuine looking packaging or through sophisticated websites, spammers are hiding spyware without consumers' knowledge. ""once the software is installed on pcs and networks, information that is given over the internet can be obtained and abused.""

the results also showed that the proportion of people reading - or admitting to reading - and taking advantage of adult entertainment spam e-mails is low, at one in 10. the research, which covered 6,000 people in six countries and their attitudes towards junk e-mails, revealed that brazilians were the most likely to read spam. a third of them read unsolicited junk e-mail and 66% buy goods or services after receiving spam.

the french were the second most likely to buy something (48%), with 44% of britons taking advantage of products and services. this was despite 38% of people in all countries being worried about their net security because of the amount of spam they get. more than a third of respondents said they were concerned that spam e-mails contained viruses or programs that attempted to collect personal information. ""both industry and the media have helped to raise awareness of the issues that surround illegitimate e-mail, helping to reduce the potential financial damage and nuisance from phishing attacks and spoof websites,"" said william plante, director of corporate security and fraud protection at security firm symantec. ""at the same time, consumers need to continue exercising caution and protect themselves from harm with a mixture of spam filters, spyware detection software and sound judgement.""

2036,"parmalat sues 45 banks over crash

parmalat has sued 45 banks as it tries to reclaim money paid to banks before the scandal-hit italian dairy company went bust last year.

the firm collapsed with debts of about 14bn euros ($19bn; â£10bn) and new boss enrico bondi has already taken legal action against a number of lenders. he claims the banks were aware of the problems but continued to work with the company so they could earn commissions. parmalat has not identified which banks it has gone after this time. under italian law, administrators can seek to get back money paid to financial institutions prior to insolvency, if there is a suspicion that the institutions knew that the company was in financial trouble. the firm also said it is preparing further law suits.

according to the reuters news agency, 35 of the companies sued on thursday are italian while the remaining 10 are international. the unidentified parmalat source also told reuters that the company was planning to take action against a total of 80 financial institutions. among those already targeted are bank of america, ubs, credit suisse first boston, deutsche bank and citigroup. it has also gone after auditors grant thornton. they have all denied any wrongdoing. parmalat was declared insolvent in december 2003 after it emerged that 4bn euros thought to be held in an offshore account did not in fact exist. in the investigation that followed it became apparent that the company, among other things, had been billing clients twice in order to boost sales and bolster the balance sheet. that enabled parmalat to borrow heavily and expand overseas, allowing it to become a darling of the italian stock exchange.

540,"henson stakes early lions claim

the six nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four home unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to new zealand with the lions this summer.

the player who staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting xv over the weekend was gavin henson. he's very confident. you just had to listen to his interview afterwards - he beamed with confidence - but although there's an element of arrogance it's good arrogance. he certainly showed some nice touches. he once showed a clean pair of heels to mathew tait when he got outside him, his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand. and that's without even mentioning his majestic match-winning penalty. but i think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test. he needs to come up against brian o'driscoll or a big french midfield. wales fly-half stephen jones was another player who impressed me. he gave good direction, he was very confident and he was a nice general for his side. he showed he can control a game. with jonny wilkinson not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and jones, or maybe even henson, could make the lions team at fly-half.

jones stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than charlie hodgson after saturday's game. some of the wales forwards surprised me because i thought they would be out-muscled in the tight five. england prop julian white is a capable player but when it comes down to selection gethin jenkins is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top. however, i still think white and phil vickery will be in the frame. some english players did their cause no harm. i thought joe worsley had a solid game and jason robinson and josh lewsey both did nothing wrong. but it looked too soon for young mathew tait and i think it will be a while before we see him again. despite being written off beforehand several scots caught my eye against france.

tom smith has been there and done it before, but the likes of chris cusiter, jason white and ally hogg all made their mark. hogg made a couple of good runs while white had a pretty robust game - his defence is right up there. cusiter looked very lively and he could be a very good option for lions coach sir clive woodward. the star of ireland's win over italy in rome looks like a certainty to make the starting xv against new zealand. brian o'driscoll is a class act. he ran some good lines against italy, made the breaks and fed his outside backs, although italy defended man on man which made it easy for him. gordon d'arcy was unlucky to go off injured early on but i think you could get a henson, d'arcy, o'driscoll combination in the lions midfield. paul o'connell just needs to add a hard edge to his game and malcolm o'kelly keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up, while shane byrne seems to be a lively character. but they will be a bit worried after the italian pack drove them off their own ball on sunday, although i used to play in italy and i know how difficult it can be. one player who didn't impress me was wales scrum-half dwayne peel. he choked late on in the second half when wales were trailing. they had good possession and he kicked the ball away - i wouldn't want him as my lions scrum-half after that.

microsoft is releasing tools that clean up pcs harbouring viruses and spyware.

the virus-fighting program will be updated monthly and is a precursor to microsoft releasing dedicated anti-virus software. also being released is a software utility that will help users find and remove any spyware on their home computer. although initially free it is thought that soon microsoft will be charging users for the anti-spyware tool.

the anti-spyware tool is available now and the anti-virus utility is expected to be available later this month. microsoft's windows operating system has long been a favourite of people who write computer viruses because it is so ubiquitous and has many loopholes that can be exploited. it has proved such a tempting target that there are now thought to be more than 100,000 viruses and other malicious programs in existence. latest research suggests that new variants of viruses are being cranked out at a rate of up to 200 per week. spyware is surreptitious software that sneaks on to home computers, often without users' knowledge. in its most benign form it just bombards users with pop-up adverts or hijacks web browser settings. the most malicious forms steal confidential information or log every keystroke that users make. surveys have shown that most pcs are infested with spyware. research by technology firms earthlink and webroot revealed that 90% of windows machine have the malicious software on board and, on average, each one harbours 28 separate spyware programs. before now microsoft has left the market for pc security software to specialist firms such as symantec, mcafee, trend micro and many others. it said that its virus cleaning program would not stop machines being infected nor remove the need for other anti-virus programs. on spyware freely available programs such as ad-aware and spybot have become widely used by people keen to keep the latest variants at bay. microsoft's two security tools have emerged as a result of acquisitions the company has made over the last two years. in 2003 it bought romanian firm gecad software to get hold of its anti-virus technology. in december 2004 it bought new york-based anti-spyware firm giant company software. last year microsoft also released the sp2 upgrade for windows xp that closed many security loopholes in the software and made it easier for people to manage their anti-virus and firewall programs.

555,"a november to remember

last saturday, one newspaper proclaimed that england were still the number one side in the world.

that statement was made to look a little foolish by events later that afternoon at twickenham. but it illustrated the wonderful unpredictability of test rugby at the highest level, at the end of a richly entertaining autumn series. the final weekend threw the world pecking order into renewed confusion, with australia's triumph in london followed by france's capitulation to new zealand. ""clearly, there is no number one side in the world at the moment,"" declared wallabies coach eddie jones on arrival back in sydney. ""there are four, five or probably six sides all competing at the same level and on any given day the difference between one side and another is only about 1%.""

while that bodes well for rugby as a whole, it also sharpens the sense of excitement ahead of what could be the most open six nations championship for a decade. while the wallabies, all blacks and springboks hit the beach before turning their attention to super 12 matters in the new year, europe's finest have less than 10 weeks before they return to the international fray. and for the first time in more than a decade, it will not simply be a straightforward choice between england and france for the six nations title.

that owes much to ireland's continued progress and the belief that wales are on the verge of delivering a major scalp to cement the promise of their autumn displays.

, who secured a first triple crown in 19 years last season, could go one better and win their first five/six nations title since 1985. they start with away games against italy and scotland, before england and france come to lansdowne road.

their momentous victory over the springboks can only bolster ireland's self-belief, while ronan o'gara's late drop goal to deliver victory over argentina was further proof that eddie o'sullivan's side can now close out tight games. not that england or france, who have won nine of the last 10 six nations titles between them, will lay down quietly.

dismantling of the springboks suggested that even after the loss of such influential figures as martin johnson and lawrence dallaglio, they still have the personnel to prosper.

the narrow defeat to australia was a timely reminder that not everything is blooming in the red rose garden, but the fresh shoots of post-world cup recovery have been sown by new head coach andy robinson. a fresh desire to regain former heights is evident, and if england emerge triumphant from an opening six nations engagement in cardiff, a fourth title in six years is within reach.

are in familiar revival territory, but this time it appears there is substance behind the rediscovered style.

while south africa's over-confidence in cardiff made for a closer scoreline than expected, wales could legitimately claim to have had victory within their grasp against the all blacks in one of the best tests in recent memory. if mike ruddock can coax a reliable set-piece platform from his pack, there is no reason why victories should not ensue come february. the last fortnight has left

in a state of bewilderment after an autumn series that began with a superb victory over australia. a stunning defeat to argentina, their first loss since the world cup, could have been attributed to trademark french inconsistency.

but the manner of new zealand's 45-6 demolition job in paris has coach bernard laporte bemoaning a lack of young talent coming through to replace the old guard. fortunately for the french, the opening match of the six nations sees them entertaining

in paris. after two reasonable performances against australia, the scots' humbling by the springboks forced coach matt williams to reassess his belief that a win over one of the major nations was imminent. while individuals such as chris cusiter and ali hogg enhanced their reputations, a lack of top-class players will continue to undermine their best efforts.

, who start with home games against ireland and wales before travelling to scotland, are also hopeful of registering more than one victory for the first time in the championship. as autumn gives way to winter and the heineken cup prepares to resume centre stage meantime, the joy of six will keep the home fires burning until february.

intel is developing ultra-wideband technology (uwb) which would allow fast data transfer but with low power needs. uwb is tipped to be used for wireless transfer of video in the home or office and for use in wireless usb devices which need low power consumption. a rival uwb standard is being developed by motorola and chip firm freescale. at the mobile phone conference 3gsm in cannes last month samsung demonstrated a phone using uwb technology from freescale.

at a press conference on thursday intel announced that two uwb groups, wimedia alliance and multi-band ofdm alliance had merged to support the technology. uwb makes it possible to stream huge amounts of data through the air over short distances. one of the more likely uses of uwb is to make it possible to send dvd quality video images wirelessly to tv screens or to let people beam music to media players around their home.

the technology has the potential to transmit hundreds of megabits of data per second.

""thirty percent of consumer electronics returns are because the consumer couldn't set up the equipment."" the first products using uwb technology from intel are due to hit the market later this year. initially they will be products using wireless usb 2.0 connections. uwb could also be used to create so-called personal area networks that let a person's gadgets quickly and easily swap data amongst themselves. the technology works over a range up to 10 metres and uses billions of short radio pulses every second to carry data. intel says the benefit of uwb is that it does not interfere with other wi-fi technologies already in use such as wi-fi, wimax and mobile phone networks.

1293,"'evil twin' fear for wireless net

people using wireless high-speed net (wi-fi) are being warned about fake hotspots, or access points.

the latest threat, nicknamed evil twins, pose as real hotspots but are actually unauthorised base stations, say cranfield university experts. once logged onto an evil twin, sensitive data can be intercepted. wi-fi is becoming popular as more devices come with wireless capability. london leads the global wi-fi hotspots league, with more than 1,000. the number of hotspots is expected to reach 200,000 by 2008, according to analysts. ""users need to be wary of using their wi-fi enabled laptops or other portable devices in order to conduct financial transactions or anything that is of a sensitive or personal nature,"" said professor brian collins, head of information systems at cranfield university.

""users can also protect themselves by ensuring that their wi-fi device has its security measures activated,"" he added. bt openzone, which operates a vast proportion of public hotspots in the uk, told the bbc news website that it made every effort to make its wi-fi secure. ""naturally, people may have security concerns,"" said chris clark, chief executive for bt's wireless broadband.

""but wi-fi networks are no more or less vulnerable than any other means of accessing the internet, like broadband or dial-up."" he said bt openzone, as well as others, have sophisticated encryption from the start of the login process to the service at a hotspot. ""this means that users' personal information and data, logon usernames and passwords are protected and secure,"" said mr clark.

in the vast majority of cases, base stations straight out of the box from the manufacturers are automatically set up with the least secure mode possible, said dr nobles. cybercriminals who try to glean personal information using the scam, jam connections to a legitimate base station by sending a stronger signal near to the wireless client. anyone with the right gear can find a real hotspot and substitute it with an evil twin. ""cybercriminals don't have to be that clever to carry out such an attack,"" said dr phil nobles, a wireless net and cybercrime expert at cranfield. ""because wireless networks are based on radio signals they can be easily detected by unauthorised users tuning into the same frequency.""

although wi-fi is increasing in popularity as more people want to use high-speed net on the move, there have been fears over how secure it is. some companies have been reluctant to use them in large numbers because of fears about security. a wireless network that is not protected can provide a backdoor into a company's computer system. public wi-fi hotspots offered by companies like bt openzone and the cloud, are accessible after users sign up and pay for use. but many home and company wi-fi networks are left unprotected and can be ""sniffed out"" and hi-jacked by anyone with the correct equipment. ""bt advises that customers should change all default settings, make sure that their security settings on all equipment are configured correctly,"" said mr clark. ""we also advocate the use of personal firewalls to ensure that only authorised users can have access and that data cannot be intercepted."" dr nobles is due to speak about wireless cybercrime at the science museum's dana centre in london on thursday.

the lawsuit, brought by 28 of the world's largest entertainment firms, has raged for several years. legal experts agree that if the supreme court finds in favour of the music and movie industry they would be able to sue file-trading firms into bankruptcy. but if the judge rules that grokster and morpheus - the file-sharers at the centre of the case - are merely providers of technology that can have legitimate as well as illegitimate uses, then the music and movie industry would be forced to abandon its pursuit of file-sharing providers. instead, they would have to pursue individuals who use peer-to-peer networks to get their hands on free music and movies. the hi-tech and entertainment industries have been divided on the issue. intel filed a document with the supreme court earlier this month in defence of grokster and others, despite misgivings about some aspects of the file-sharing community. it summed up the attitude of many tech firms in its submission which states that its products ""are essentially tools, that like any other tools, capable of being used by consumers and businesses for unlawful purposes"".

asking firms to second-guess the uses that its technologies would be put to, and to build in ways of preventing illegitimate use, would stifle innovation, it said. the electronic frontier foundation, a civil rights watchdog, is also defending streamcast networks, the company behind the morpheus file-sharing software. the case raises a question of critical importance at the border between copyright and innovation, it said. it cites, as do many, the landmark ruling in 1984 which found that sony should not be held responsible for the fact that its betamax video recorder could be used for piracy. defenders remain optimistic that the judges will rule in favour of the peer-to-peer networks, upholding the precedent set by the sony betamax case. a small band of supporters were outside the court as the lawyers entered, wearing ""save betamax"" t-shirts. ""the betamax principles stand as the magna carta for the technology industry and are responsible for the explosion in innovation that has occurred in the us over the past 20 years,"" said gary shapiro, chief executive of the consumer electronics association. supreme court justice stephen breyer said that inventions from printing to apple's ipod could be used to illegally duplicate copyrighted materials but had, on balance, been beneficial to society. he said that while file-trading software can be used to illegally trade movies and music, conceptually the technology had ""some really excellent uses"".

based on tuesday's hearing it seems unlikely that the betamax ruling will be overturned but file-sharing firms might still be held responsible for encouraging or inducing piracy. grokster's lawyer argued that the company should be judged by its current behaviour rather than what it did when it first set up. but this argument was dismissed as ""ridiculous"" by justice david souter. cea boss mr shapiro thinks the case is the most important that the supreme court will hear this year. ""it's about preserving america's proud history of technological innovation and protecting the ability of consumers to access and utilise technology,"" he said. the case has already been heard by two lower courts and both found in favour of the peer-to-peer networks. they ruled that despite being used to distribute millions of illegal songs, file-sharing could also be used to cheaply distribute software, government documents and promotional copies of music.

1972,"ukraine strikes turkmen gas deal

ukraine has agreed to pay 30% more for natural gas supplied by turkmenistan.

the deal was sealed three days after turkmenistan cut off gas supplies in a price dispute that threatened the ukrainian economy. supplies from turkmenistan account for 45% of all natural gas imported by ukraine, which has large coal deposits but no gas fields. turkmenistan is also trying to strike a similar deal with russia, which is not so dependent on its gas. turkmen president saparmurat niyazov, who signed the contract, said the turkmen side agreed to lower the price demanded by $2 per 1,000 cubic metres, bringing it down to $58. but the new price is still $14 higher than the price fixed in the contract for 2004. the head of the ukrainian state-owned naftohaz company, yury boyko, said he was ""fully happy"" with the deal. on friday, turkmenistan acted on a threat and shut off gas supplies to ukraine in attempt to bring the price dispute to a head. mr niyazov said that his government would insist on the same price for supplies to russia. analysts say thay may not happen as russia, the world's leading gas producer, needs the cheap turkmen gas only to relieve is state-owned gazprom from costly investment in the exploration of oil fields in siberia. turkmenistan is the second-largest gas producer in the world.

1385,"stars pay tribute to actor davis

hollywood stars including spike lee, burt reynolds and oscar nominee alan alda have paid tribute to actor ossie davis at a funeral in new york.

veteran star ossie davis, a well-known civil rights activist, died in miami at the age of 87 on 4 february 2005. friends and family, including actress ruby dee his wife of 56 years, gathered at the riverside church on saturday. also present at the service was former us president bill clinton and singer harry belafonte, who gave the eulogy. ""he would have been a very good president of the united states,"" said mr clinton. ""like most of you here, he gave more to me than i gave to him.""

the 87-year-old was found dead last weekend in his hotel room in florida, where he was making a film. police said that he appeared to have died of natural causes. davis made his acting debut in 1950 in no way out starring sidney poiter. he frequently collaborated with director spike lee, starring in seven lee films including jungle fever, do the right thing and malcolm x. attallah shabazz, the daughter of activist malcolm x, recalled the famous eulogy delivered by davis at her father's funeral. ""harlem has come to bid farewell to one of its finest hopes,"" she said, quoting the man she knew as uncle ossie. ""ditto."" ""ossie was my hero, and he still is,"" said aviator star alan alda, a family friend for over forty years. ""ossie was a thing of beauty.""

""i want so badly someday to have his dignity - a little of it anyway,"" added burt reynolds, davis's co-star in the 90s tv comedy evening shade. before the midday funeral, scores of harlem residents formed a queue outside the church to pay their respects to davis. ""it is hard to fathom that we will no longer be able to call on his wisdom, his humour, his loyalty and his moral strength to guide us in the choices that are yet to be made and the battles that are yet to be fought,"" said belafonte, himself an ardent civil rights activist who had been friends with davis for over 60 years. ""but how fortunate we were to have him as long as we did.""

664,"rangers seal old firm win

goals from gregory vignal and nacho novo gave rangers a scrappy victory at celtic park that moves them three points clear of the champions.

rangers had rarely threatened until celtic goalkeeper rab douglas let defender vignal's 25-yard drive slip through his grasp and into the net. opposite number ronald waterreus had been rangers' hero, saving superbly from craig bellamy and john hartson. striker novo secured victory, lobbing douglas with eight minutes remaining. it ended celtic's 11-game unbeaten run at home in old firm derbies and gave rangers manager alex mcleish his first victory at the home of his glasgow rivals. celtic had won their last six meetings on their home pitch, including twice already this season. they started confidently, with new signing bellamy, on loan from newcastle united, given his celtic debut up front with wales international colleague john hartson and chris sutton dropping into midfield. it took bellamy just four minutes to threaten, taking on marvin andrews before delivering a low drive that was held by waterreus at the second attempt. he had an even better chance after hartson dispossesed sotiris kyrgiakos and sent his strike partner clear with only the goalkeeper to beat. but waterreus did well to beat away bellamy's disappointing low drive from 16 yards. waterreus came to the rescue again when the ball fell to hartson just inside the box and the dutch goalkeeper made a brave block. it was an old firm return for barry ferguson as mcleish stuck by the side that thumped four goals past hibernian. but rangers found celtic harder to break down and douglas was not threatened until 10 minutes after the break. dado prso turned inside neil lennon only for the celtic goalkeeper to beat away his powerful 18-yard drive. a great defensive header by andrews prevented hartson pouncing from five yards out. hartson foxed vignal at the edge of the rangers box, but the striker's shot on the turn was again beaten away by waterreus. rangers were beginning to dominate the midfield and vignal, collecting a knock back from fernando ricksen, broke the deadlock, douglas somehow letting the frenchman's dipping drive slip through his grasp. novo pounced on a moments' hesitation in the celtic defence to latch on to a long ball from ricksen and lob the ball over the advancing douglas. ricksen appeared to be hit by a coin, but it could not prevent rangers' celebrations at the final whistle.

1223,"media gadgets get moving

pocket-sized devices that let people carry around video and images are set to have a big year in 2005, according to industry experts.

last year saw the emergence of portable media players, such as the windows-based creative zen portable media player, the samsung yepp, the iriver pmc-100, and the archos av400 series among others. but this year, they are set to get smarter and more connected, to allow people to find more video to watch on them. archos launched its latest range of its linux-based portable media devices at the consumer electronics show in las vegas on friday. dubbed the pocket media assistant pma430, it crucially has wi-fi capability built-in for the first time. ""consumers are showing a great thirst for devices that store all their media in one place for anywhere access,"" said henri crohas, chief of archos. ""and now those consumers can stay connected and productive at the same time."" archos said the focus for the device is to be the second gadget in people's pockets, after the mobile.

unlike windows-based players, the archos av400 series devices have always been able to record from any video source, such as tvs, as well as playback. the content put onto the devices is copy protected so cannot then be swapped to another device.

recording is perhaps a crucial functionality for those who have not seen the point of portable video if there is not a lot of video to watch on it. and wi-fi connectivity opens up the possibility of content delivery via a high-speed wireless link. archos also announced that it would open up the software development kit to linux developers so that more applications could be created for the device. microsoft also made some announcements in the portable media arena at ces, primarily for us consumers though. it has agreed a content deal with personal video recorder company tivo, which bill gates also showcased in his keynote speech at ces. the tivo to go service means that us consumers will be able to take any programmes they record on their tivos and transfer it for free to watch on any of the windows-based portable media players or smartphones. it also said it had launched a service with mtv to let people watch comedy central, vh1 and country music tv on its devices. and a service is launching with msn to provide people with shortened versions of news, entertainment and other video on a subscription basis for download via the pc onto the portable devices. but the ability to record directly from tv, vcr, and digital cable and satellite boxes, which windows-based devices do not offer, certainly gives people more content to watch on the go too.

the increased capability of these devices, and the content deals that are being done, may go some way to persuading people to use them. recent research by jupiter suggested that people would prefer a device that was dedicated to music. only 13% of europeans wanted to watch video while on the move. more seemed interested in spending their cash on music-only devices.

""this year, we are ready for an explosion of portable media,"" microsoft's mike coleman told the bbc news website. ""we are very bullish about it. the fact that i can put photos on here too and share them is super-cool to the consumer,"" he added. the fact that europeans are far larger public transport users than americans is one reason why portable media will take off in the coming year too. there is a burgeoning market there for commuters to watch news and other programmes on their way to work. although microsoft's content distribution deals are for the us market at the moment, talks were ""always on-going"" with european content suppliers to offer similar services. various rights management issues have to be ironed out first however. but that does not prevent people from finding ways to create their own content to share online and swap on portable devices, particularly via those which are wi-fi enabled. the possibility is open for non-professional makers of video and audio to take advantage of the growing portable media market to distribute their work. ces, which runs from 6 to 9 january, showcases more than 50,000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005.

1279,"blind student 'hears in colour'

a blind student has developed software that turns colours into musical notes so that he can read weather maps.

victor wong, a graduate student from hong kong studying at cornell university in new york state, had to read coloured maps of the upper atmosphere as part of his research. to study ""space weather"" mr wong needed to explore minute fluctuations in order to create mathematical models. a number of solutions were tried, including having a colleague describe the maps and attempting to print them in braille. mr wong eventually hit upon the idea of translating individual colours into music, and enlisted the help of a computer graphics specialist and another student to do the programming work.

""the images have three dimensions and i had to find a way of reading them myself,"" mr wong told the bbc news website. ""for the sake of my own study - and for the sake of blind scientists generally - i felt it would be good to develop software that could help us to read colour images."" he tried a prototype version of the software to explore a photograph of a parrot. in order to have an exact reference to the screen, a pen and tablet device is used. the software then assigns one of 88 piano notes to individually coloured pixels - ranging from blue at the lower end of this scale to red at the upper end. mr wong says the application is still very much in its infancy and is only useful for reading images that have been created digitally. ""if i took a random picture and scanned it and then used my software to recognise it, it wouldn't work that well.""

mr wong has been blind from the age of seven and he thinks that having a ""colour memory"" makes the software more useful than it would be to a scientist who had never had any vision. ""as the notes increase in pitch i know the colour's getting redder and redder, and in my mind's eye a patch of red appears."" the colour to music software has not yet been made available commercially, and mr wong believes that several people would have to work together to make it viable. but he hopes that one day it can be developed to give blind people access to photographs and other images.

74,"burglar defence guidelines issued

householders who injure or even kill intruders are unlikely to be prosecuted - providing they were acting ""honestly and instinctively"", new guidelines say.

the law also protects those who use ""something to hand"" as a weapon. the leaflet, published by police and prosecutors, aims to combat confusion about current legislation, which lets people use ""reasonable force"". the guidance, relating to england and wales, follows a recent decision by ministers not to change the law. doing what you ""honestly and instinctively"" believed was necessary would be the strongest evidence of acting lawfully, the guidance said.

and the law protects those who use ""something to hand"" as a weapon, said the leaflet published jointly by the crown prosecution service (cps) and association of chief police officers (acpo).

as a general rule, the more extreme the circumstances and fear felt, the more force can be used lawfully in self-defence, it said, adding that householders do not have to wait to be attacked before defending themselves. but knocking someone unconscious then killing them or hurting them further, or setting a trap for an intruder without involving the police were given as examples of ""excessive and gratuitous"" force. the tories have called for a change in the law so householders are only prosecuted if they use ""grossly disproportionate"" force. their demands have been backed by former metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens. tory frontbencher patrick mercer is now pursuing the proposal through a private member's bill in parliament.

the government instead mounted a publicity campaign to clear up public uncertainty after a review concluded no law change was necessary. home secretary charles clarke said: ""i believe in that old adage 'an englishman's home is his castle'. that's exactly what should be the case and i believe the current law provides that."" an ""informal trawl"" of cps records found 11 people had been prosecuted after attacking intruders in the past 15 years, five of whom were convicted. they included a man who laid in wait for a burglar on commercial premises in cheshire, before beating him up, throwing him into a pit and setting him on fire.

a cps spokesperson said the figures were not definitive because prosecutions are not listed according to whether they were committed by a householder on an intruder. in one of britain's highest profile cases, norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for life for murdering 16-year-old burglar fred barras, in 1999. the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter on appeal and the sentence cut to five years. mr martin was freed from prison in july 2003. the guidance published on tuesday, said the police had a duty to investigate all incidents involving a death or injury. in cases involving householders attacking intruders prosecutors and police were ""determined"" they would be dealt with ""as swiftly and as sympathetically as possible"", it said.

1026,"broadband challenges tv viewing

the number of europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months, with the web eating into tv viewing habits, research suggests.

just over 54 million people are hooked up to the net via broadband, up from 34 million a year ago, according to market analysts nielsen/netratings. the total number of people online in europe has broken the 100 million mark. the popularity of the net has meant that many are turning away from tv, say analysts jupiter research. it found that a quarter of web users said they spent less time watching tv in favour of the net

the report by nielsen/netratings found that the number of people with fast internet access had risen by 60% over the past year.

the biggest jump was in italy, where it rose by 120%. britain was close behind, with broadband users almost doubling in a year. the growth has been fuelled by lower prices and a wider choice of always-on, fast-net subscription plans. ""twelve months ago high speed internet users made up just over one third of the audience in europe; now they are more than 50% and we expect this number to keep growing,"" said gabrielle prior, nielsen/netratings analyst. ""as the number of high-speed surfers grows, websites will need to adapt, update and enhance their content to retain their visitors and encourage new ones."" the total number of europeans online rose by 12% to 100 million over the past year, the report showed, with the biggest rise in france, italy, britain and germany.

the ability to browse web pages at high speed, download files such as music or films and play online games is changing what people do in their spare time.

a study by analysts jupiter research suggested that broadband was challenging television viewing habits. in homes with broadband, 40% said they were spending less time watching tv. the threat to tv was greatest in countries where broadband was on the up, in particular the uk, france and spain, said the report. it said tv companies faced a major long-term threat over the next five years, with broadband predicted to grow from 19% to 37% of households by 2009. ""year-on-year we are continuing to see a seismic shift in where, when and how europe's population consume media for information and entertainment and this has big implications for tv, newspaper and radio,"" said jupiter research analyst olivier beauvillian.

399,"eu referendum question unveiled

the question to be asked in the referendum on the eu constitution has been unveiled by the government.

it will be: ""should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union?"" the constitution will be incorporated into uk law if there is a yes vote in the referendum, expected in 2006. critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state eu. ""if we reject this treaty, britain will be isolated and weak in europe,"" said foreign secretary jack straw, who along with the rest of the cabinet, will back a ""yes"" vote.

patriots by definition wanted the uk to be prosperous at home and strong and influential abroad, mr straw said. ""our role as a leading member of the eu is a crucial part of securing that.""

conservative shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said the referendum question ""seems straightforward"". but he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the eu referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as ""two separate issues"". despite this ""underhand trick,"" the referendum bill stood ""no chance of becoming law before the election,"" he added. ""this is tony blair's cheap gesture to the pro-constitution lobby while he runs scared of a debate on europe he knows he cannot win."" neil o'brien, director of anti-constitution group vote no, said: ""the reality is that the government doesn't want to discuss the eu constitution ahead of the election because they know it is extremely unpopular with voters and with business.""

the uk independence party said: ""if the government believes that a no vote would mean that we should leave the european union, they should just ask us if we want to leave the eu. then we can be out of it and better off much sooner.""

liberal democrat leader charles kennedy, who backs the constitution, said he expected the referendum would come in the first half of next year. he told bbc radio 4's today programme: ""the sooner we get on with this, the better."" he said the question sounded ""very neutral"" and ""balanced,"" adding it would enable the argument ""to be enjoined fairly and squarely on both sides"". green mep caroline lucas welcomed tony blair's ""courage in keeping his word"" on holding a referendum. but she added: ""this treaty is a flawed document that will make the eu less accountable, less sustainable, and less just.""

mr blair signed the constitution at a ceremony in rome in november, but had already made it clear the issue would be put to voters in a referendum. that promise came after sustained pressure from opposition parties. jack straw, who argues the constitution reflected a ""british vision for europe"" and gives ""national governments a stronger grip"", has said the referendum could be held in spring 2006. but in an interview with the financial times, mr blair refused to be pinned down to that date, saying britain would hold a poll ""some time in 2006 but when, i don't know"". the paper said the prime minister ""claimed ignorance"" of when other countries were planning to hold their referendums.

1621,"stern dropped from radio stations

controversial dj howard stern has been dropped from four us radio stations because he keeps promoting his move to a network broadcasting on satellite.

cidatel broadcasting said stern had transformed his show into a ""continuous infomercial promoting sirius, his new satellite radio employer"". stern will join the sirius subscription service, which is not governed by us regulators, next year. citadel pulled stern's show from stations in new york and pennsylvania. stern had been holiday for two weeks but his show did not return to the four stations as expected on 3 january. citadel said it did not yet know whether it would return to its network.

stern announced in october that he was leaving conventional radio, where his syndicated show goes out across the us, for the relatively restriction-free satellite service. the dj's broadcasts are well known for landing in trouble with regulators for obscene and sexually explicit rantings. stern was dropped by six stations owned by media giant clear channel in 2004 after it had to pay the federal communications commission $1.75m (â£950,000), over breaches indecency laws. media giant viacom has also reportedly agreed to the fcc's demands that if stern is issued with another indecency violation then his show must be pulled from all of its stations. viacom has also been hit with record fines of $3.5m (â£1.8m) over stern and two other new york djs. but stern continues to be one of the most popular talk show hosts, particularly in the 25-54 age category.

1446,"church anger over bollywood film

roman catholic organisations in india have demanded the withdrawal of a film that depicts a priest having an affair with a girl half his age.

indian television channels are now refusing to run the promotional material for the film, sins, ahead of its release on friday. the director of the film, vinod pande, says the movie is not offensive and has refused to withdraw it. catholics are planning a protest in mumbai (bombay) on wednesday. the president of one of mumbai's main catholic organisations, dolphy d'souza, says the portrayal of an ordained priest as a man of loose moral character has hurt the religious sentiments of india's catholic community.

he called the film ""pornographic and sensational"". mr d'souza, who is also the vice-president of the catholics' national body, has accused the director of the film of portraying a priest in bad light for commercial gains. catholics have urged mr pande to withdraw the film to show respect to the christian community's hurt sentiments. ""religion needs to be a personal affair and should not be a subject for entertainment or for commercial use,"" joseph dias, general secretary of the catholic secular forum, said in a statement.

but mr pande said that if the critics were to see the film they would not protest against it and would not insist on its withdrawal. he says he has no plans to cancel the film ahead of its scheduled screening on friday.

""it's about forbidden love. there was no agenda whatsoever to hurt anyone,"" he said. the bbc's zubair ahmed in mumbai says that the controversial film shows a priest in steamy scenes with a girl half his age. she apparently goes to him for help but he falls in love with her. it takes place in the picturesque southern indian state of kerala. the film has already been cleared by the censor board with an 'a' (adults only) certificate. mr d'souza says he is shocked at the censor board's decision to clear the film. our correspondent says that india's tv channels have so far refused to be dragged into the controversy and have not screened the film's promotional material. most of the catholic community's anger has come after watching newspaper advertisements and hoardings of the film. christians make up about two per cent of india's population of more than a billion people.

1272,"apple makes blogs reveal sources

apple has won its legal fight to make three bloggers reveal who told them about unreleased products.

the bid to unmask the employees leaking information was launched in december 2004 following online articles about apple's asteroid product. now apple has won the right to see e-mail records from the three bloggers to root out the culprit. a lawyer for the three bloggers said the ruling set a dangerous precedent that could harm all news reporters.

apple's lawsuit accused anonymous people of stealing trade secrets about the asteroid music product and leaking them to the powerpage, apple insider and think secret websites. all three are apple fan sites that obsessively watch the iconic firm for information about future products. apple is notoriously secretive about upcoming products which gives any snippets of information about what it is working on all the more value. the lawsuit to reveal the names of the leakers was filed against the power page and apple insider sites.

the separate legal fight with think secret has yet to be resolved. in the ruling handed down this week by santa clara county superior court judge james kleinberg, apple can now get its hands on e-mail records from the bloggers' net providers. in making his ruling, judge kleinberg said that laws covering the divulging of trade secrets outweighed considerations of public interest. california has so-called ""shield"" laws which protect journalists from prosecution if what they are writing about can be shown to be in the public interest. the judge wrote: ""...it is not surprising that hundreds of thousands of 'hits' on a website about apple have and will happen. but an interested public is not the same as the public interest"". judge kleinberg said the question of whether the bloggers were journalists or not did not apply because laws governing the right to keep trade secrets confidential covered journalists, too. the electronic frontier foundation, which is acting as legal counsel for power page and apple insider, said the ruling had potentially wide implications. ""anyone who reports on companies or the trade press should be concerned about this ruling,"" said eff lawyer kurt opsahl. mr opsahl said the eff was planning to appeal against the ruling because the bloggers were journalists and us federal laws stop net firms handing over copies of e-mail messages if the owner of that account does not give their consent.

1898,"millions go missing at china bank

two senior officials at one of china's top commercial banks have reportedly disappeared after funds worth up to $120m (â£64m) went missing.

the pair both worked at bank of china in the northern city of harbin, the south china morning post reported. the latest scandal at bank of china will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that china's big four banks are ready for international listings. government policy sees the bank listings as vital economic reforms. bank of china is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. the other is china construction bank. both are expected to list abroad during 2005.

they shared a $45bn state bailout in 2003, to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut.

however, a report in the china-published economic observer said on monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in new york because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the enron scandal. bank of china is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while china construction bank is the largest deposit holder. china's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. officially, one in five loans is not being repaid. attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. the most high-profile case involved the ex-president of bank of china, wang xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003. although, he committed the offences whilst running bank of china in new york, mr wang was head of china construction bank when the scandal broke. earlier this month, a china construction bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.

china's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. the introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector, but links between banks and local government remain strong. last year, china's premier, wen jiabao, targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches, and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised, in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. china's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of china's economic boom. but two problems persist. first, inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people. second, many questionable loans come not from the big four, but from smaller banks. another high profile financial firm, china life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the us securities and exchange commission following its 2004 new york listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.

299,"kilroy launches 'veritas' party

ex-bbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroy-silk said he wanted to ""change the face of british politics"" as he launched his new party. mr kilroy-silk, who recently quit the uk independence party, said ""our country"" was being ""stolen from us"" by mass immigration. he told a london news conference that veritas - latin for ""truth"" - would avoid the old parties' ""lies and spin"". ukip leader roger knapman says he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk.

mr kilroy-silk promised a ""firm but fair"" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks. labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said veritas was joining ""an already crowded field on the right of british politics"". on thursday mr kilroy-silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoon's ashfield seat. he was joined in the new venture by one of ukip's two london assembly members, damien hockney who is now veritas' deputy leader. ukip's chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.

mr kilroy-silk quit ukip last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had ""gone awol"" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june's european elections. ""while ukip has turned its back on the british people, i shall not,"" he said. ""i will be standing at the next general election. i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in. ""and, unlike the old parties, we shall be honest, open and straight.""

mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroy-silk would ""deliver better"" as the leader of a eurosceptic party. a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly. the party asserts that mr hockney ""has a moral obligation, if not a legal one"" to stand down. its leader, roger knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk. ""he has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [european] election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',"" he said. ukip officials also argue mr kilroy-silk has not been ""straightforward"" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.

veritas? it's the bnp in an expensive suit!

it's all well and good robert kilroy-silk claiming, that 'veritas' is a party that doesn't believe in ""lies and spin"", but the truth of the matter is, its completely useless, due to proportional representation, there is no chance that 'veritas' will have any chance in claiming power, and change the two-horse race trend. in my opinion this is just a publicity stunt which has just been used as a smoke-screen for his anti-islamism slurs which got him sacked from the television.

i think that his views regarding immigration are shared by many. it really is time that the uk government ceased to be a paper tiger on this issue. in addition as an ashfield constituent i would be more than interested in kilroy -silk opposing geoff hoon!!

good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done. let's hope kilroy-silk, ukip and the euro-sceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe. we benefit enormously from our membership of the eu, we need to be at the heart of europe, leading it and driving it to where we as a country want to go, not running away from it.

all mouth and trousers. a clown. trouble is, any votes he collects may just end up helping new labour into a third term.

whatever kilroy-silk and ukip do, none of their anti-european policies have any relevance outside middle england. this new party might gain support from right-wing england, but will have little impact in wales or scotland.

hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue. england needs europe to survive and as soon as people realise this the better, we can't rely on the usa forever!

at last an impetus for increasing the likely 40% turn out for the election. the electorate is disillusioned with british politics. kilroy has one agenda - the uk - and i'll be voting for him.

both ukip and rk-s are representatives of small-mindedness and a lack of vision for the whole of humankind. the interests of humanity and the world lie so much beyond the scope of these people's bickering that who, in the overall scheme of things, really cares about their petty tiff?

many people believe you kilroy. you may even believe yourself but switching horses midstream and then bad mouthing the steed that got you halfway seriously diminishes your credibility.

the very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseating. one can only hope the public recognise these extremists for what they are and shun them at the polls.

i've always thought that kilroy-silk was a self-publicising, egotist and this news does absolutely nothing to alter my opinion.

brilliant, about time this country had a plausible party!

having seen the recent bbc 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figures i can well understand why kilroy-silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people. hopefully the ukip members who are interested in the political debate will support his action.

fantastic news. pro-europeans now have far less to worry about from the right. the conservatives are as confused as they have been since the mid-1990s, and the extreme anti-europeans are fracturing themselves into splinter groups that split any votes they might get in local, european and general elections. robert kilroy-silk's ego and vanity are his own (and his supporters') worst enemy.

as a euro-enthusiast i could not be more delighted by kilroy-silk's behaviour. he took a party that was just building up a head of steam, and having exposed it to ridicule by attempting a coup-d'etat, he is now setting about the serious business of dividing it in two. the closer to straight-down-the-middle the better, as far as i am concerned, but in any eventuality, the two sceptic parties will exhaust their energies fighting each other.

if every politician with ambitions to lead their party resorted to forming their own for that purpose, we'd have ballot papers a mile long! you've got to hand it to kilroy-silk for his sheer arrogance and supreme self-belief.

whilst not being a great fan of kilroy i do agree with his comments about the ukip leadership, and like him i am also leaving ukip. i believe countless opportunities have been lost to discredit the eu and to show our people what belonging to the eu really means. the eu's comments last week about michael howard's plans to reform immigration show how little we govern our own country when they can turn round and say immigration is a matter for the eu and not individual member states. the sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better

does anyone else think that it is ironic that euro-sceptic kilroy-silk has used a latin name for his new party, rather than a 'good old british' name? is this indicative of the man - contradictory, vain and pompous?

i think mr kilroy-silk has got a very good point. british politics has become too pc and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians. they are all interested in their own careers and not the people who put them in power. as a result i feel our democracy is being abused and i want it stopped. if mr kilroy-silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote.

honestly, who really cares? man with tan leaves party with no plan, to set up party with no idea.

as one of kilroy-silk's east midlands constituents i hope those who voted for him are proud to have been taken in by such charming vacuity. i feel insulted by having him represent me in the european parliament.

ukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk, but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him. someone so keen on complete control was bound to fall foul of ukip's democratic nature.

kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician, in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not. he tried to make it work, but they didn't seem to want to grow up. he was left in the position of having to defend their gaffes to the media. this new party seems a logical next step for kilroy. good luck to the man, i say.

oh please! this is an amusing irrelevance. there is absolutely no chance of either of these parties communicating a sensible and constructive 'eurosceptic' argument. they will play a key part in winning the country round to the idea of a reformed, more democratic, more dynamic europe union. future generations will thank him for his ridiculousness.

the refreshing thing about robert is that he is open, honest and straight. what other politician can claim this. i have a suspicion that he talks for a larger part of the electorate that his critics would like. i shall be voting for him.

the electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroy-silk but for the ukip. kilroy-silk was made an mep because of his position on the ukip's party list. he has no mandate to represent the area and should resign from the european parliament.

i wouldn't write off kilroy-silk. while he's a clown and a one man band at the moment, he's a populist and that's always dangerous.the man clearly has an enormous ego and looking at our current political masters, that seems to be one of the factors in success.

good luck to kilroy though i think he is doing more harm than good for both his new party and ukip because their vote base is not strong enough for both parties to be successful and at the moment ukip have the upper hand while veritas are starting from square one and fighting a somewhat uphill battle.

the man i once found cringe worthy on day time tv, could well turn out to be my country's knight in shining armour. he expresses views which are now more than common amongst society today - but people are almost too scared to express them. kilroy silk has secured my vote, and many more like me. what's more, i look forward to the day when he claims victory, wrecks the eu, and rescues my great nation... without a hair out of place and his tan as perfect as ever!

great stuff. the longer the uk dithers over europe, the richer we in ireland become, as the only english-speaking country fully committed to europe. oh and send us over those hard-working immigrants - our economy needs them.

this is just what the europhiles pray for. as the main eurosceptic party, ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe. having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.

thank goodness that kilroy-silk has gone - now ukip at least has a chance in the election!

it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip. robert kilroy-silk could have a lot to offer. instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation. last summer, ukip achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to kilroy-silk. it is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting.

ukip has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the eu. this kilroy-silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party. neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes. veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy-silk.

if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.

so ukip was good enough for him to lead, not good enough for him to follow!

interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name!

every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-europe feeling in this country. kilroy-silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. we wants quality schools, top hospitals, clean and efficient public transport, punishments that fit the crime, limited asylum, a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. it needs courage and honesty, two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. kilroy-silk may just have those very qualities. recruit the right colleagues, robert, and your time may have come!

well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party. it's all flash and no real policy here

let's hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy-silk slipping into obscurity.

veritas? the name will doom it. but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not? the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism, so explain to me how the too-twee label of veritas symbolises that?

now ukip at least has a chance in the election!let's hope kilroy-silk, ukip and the euro-sceptic wing of the tory party all fade further into obscurity so we can have some truth in the debate about europe.mr kilroy-silk, who recently quit the uk independence party, said ""our country"" was being ""stolen from us"" by mass immigration.i think mr kilroy-silk has got a very good point.kilroy-silk was made an mep because of his position on the ukip's party list.the sooner we leave this corrupt super-state the better  does anyone else think that it is ironic that euro-sceptic kilroy-silk has used a latin name for his new party, rather than a 'good old british' name?""while ukip has turned its back on the british people, i shall not,"" he said.hopefully this all this fighting within euro-sceptic parties will allow them to slip out of the way and get people voting for real political parties which address more than one issue.ex-bbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroy-silk said he wanted to ""change the face of british politics"" as he launched his new party.good to see the parties of the right splintering in the way the parties of the left have always done.man with tan leaves party with no plan, to set up party with no idea.the electorate of the east midlands voted not for kilroy-silk but for the ukip.its leader, roger knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk.this kilroy-silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party.ukip leader roger knapman says he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk.as the main eurosceptic party, ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe.it's all well and good robert kilroy-silk claiming, that 'veritas' is a party that doesn't believe in ""lies and spin"", but the truth of the matter is, its completely useless, due to proportional representation, there is no chance that 'veritas' will have any chance in claiming power, and change the two-horse race trend.veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy-silk.this new party seems a logical next step for kilroy.ukip's chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.brilliant, about time this country had a plausible party!it's all flash and no real policy here  let's hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy-silk slipping into obscurity.whilst not being a great fan of kilroy i do agree with his comments about the ukip leadership, and like him i am also leaving ukip.having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.the party asserts that mr hockney ""has a moral obligation, if not a legal one"" to stand down.robert kilroy-silk could have a lot to offer.kilroy-silk may just have those very qualities.ukip has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the eu.whatever kilroy-silk and ukip do, none of their anti-european policies have any relevance outside middle england.instead we have a split party and a damaged cause.kilroy has one agenda - the uk - and i'll be voting for him.if mr kilroy-silk lives up to half his promises he will get my vote.on thursday mr kilroy-silk is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoon's ashfield seat.mr kilroy-silk promised a ""firm but fair"" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election.having seen the recent bbc 3 documentary and witnessed the thoroughly disgraceful chauvinistic behaviour of a number of senior ukip figures i can well understand why kilroy-silk feels embarrassed to be associated with such people.he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had ""gone awol"" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june's european elections.interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name!last summer, ukip achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to kilroy-silk.ukip tried hard to accommodate robert kilroy silk, but he made it clear that only control of it would satisfy him.british politics has become too pc and as a result has no straight talking honest strong politicians.i wouldn't write off kilroy-silk.the very idea of political parties born out of such negative feelings as euroscepticism or british supremacy is nauseating.under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation.kilroy silk has secured my vote, and many more like me.kilroy is an able communicator and a capable politician, in exactly the way those who lead ukip are not.kilroy-silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue.he was joined in the new venture by one of ukip's two london assembly members, damien hockney who is now veritas' deputy leader.if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.so ukip was good enough for him to lead, not good enough for him to follow!",politics,2393,1048
1860,"no seasonal lift for house market

a swathe of figures have provided further evidence of a slowdown in the uk property market.

the council of mortgage lenders (cml), british bankers association (bba) and building societies association (bsa) all said mortgage lending was slowing. cml figures showed gross lending fell by 4% in november as the number of people buying new homes fell. elsewhere, the bba added underlying mortgage lending rose by â£4m in november, compared to october's â£4.29m. the cml said that loans for new property purchases fell 25% year-on-year to 85,000 - the lowest total seen since february 2003.

data from the cml showed lending fell to just over â£25bn in november, from â£25.5bn a year earlier. separate figures from the building societies association showed the value of mortgage approvals -- loans agreed but not yet made -- stood 32% lower than at the same time last year, at a seasonally-adjusted â£2.98bn. the figures come hot on the heels of new data from property website rightmove which suggested owners must indulge in a ""winter sale"" and slash prices by up to 8%. miles shipside, commercial director at rightmove, said sellers would have to be ""more realistic with their asking prices"" to tempt buyers. the average asking price of a home fell by more than â£600 from â£190,329 in november to â£189,733 in december, while the length of time it takes to sell a home rose to 81 days from 53 in the summer.

rightmove said estate agents were set to enter 2005 with a third more properties on their books than a year ago. ""even once the quieter holiday period is over, sellers will find themselves competing with a lot of other properties on the market. in any business, excess supply and low demand means one thing - cut prices,"" mr shipside said.

""the proof is that some properties that have been appropriately discounted are selling, even in the current market."" overall, asking prices have fallen 3.3% from their july peaks as the equivalent of â£6,500 has been cut from an average property. a host of mortgage lenders and economists have predicted that property prices will either fall or stagnate in 2005. ""what is apparent is a picture of a slowing market, but one that should remain stable as we return to more normal volumes of lending over 2005 as a whole,"" cml director general michael coogan said. ""it's a fairly consistent picture, showing that mortgage demand has fallen back again, which is consistent with a continuing correction in the housing market,"" investec economist philip shaw said. ""however, the figures do suggest only a modest weakening, and we stand by our view that the property market will remain in the doldrums for some time, though a collapse is still unlikely.""

six uk greyhound tracks have been put up for sale by gaming group wembley as part of a move which will lead to the break-up of the group.

wembley announced the planned sale as it revealed it was to offload its us gaming division to blb investors. us gaming consortium blb will pay $339m (â£182.5m) for the us unit, although the deal is subject to certain conditions. blb holds a 22% stake in wembley and last year came close to buying the whole firm in a â£308m takeover deal. shares in wembley were up 56 pence, or 7.6%, at 797p by mid-morning.

the sale of the us gaming unit will leave wembley with its uk business. this includes greyhound tracks at wimbledon in london, belle vue in manchester, perry barr and hall green in birmingham, oxford and portsmouth. analysts have valued the six tracks at between â£40m-â£50m. the us business accounts for about 90% of wembley's operating profit and consists of operations in rhode island and colorado. blb's purchase of the us unit is subject to the agreement of a revenue-sharing deal being struck with rhode island authorities. wembley said that, once the deal was completed, it anticipated returning surplus cash to shareholders. ""whilst the completion of the sale of the us gaming division remains subject to a number of conditions, we believe this development is a positive step towards the maximisation of value for shareholders,"" said wembley chairman claes hultman. wembley sold the english national football stadium in 1999 to concentrate on its gaming operations.

965,"dvd copy protection strengthened

dvds will be harder to copy thanks to new anti-piracy measures devised by copy protection firm macrovision.

the pirated dvd market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago. macrovision says its new ripguard technology will thwart most, but not all, of the current dvd ripping (copying) programs used to pirate dvds. ""ripguard is designed to... reduce dvd ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer,"" said the firm. macrovision said the new technology will work in ""nearly all"" current dvd players when applied to the discs, but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with ripguard. the new technology will be welcomed by hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from dvd sales.

the film industry has stepped up efforts to fight dvd piracy in the last 12 months, taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of dvd movies for download.

""ultimately, we see ripguard dvd... evolving beyond anti-piracy, and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions, interoperability in tomorrow's digital home, and the upcoming high-definition formats,"" said steve weinstein, executive vice president and general manager of macrovision's entertainment technologies group. macrovision said ripguard was designed to plug the ""digital hole"" that was created by so-called decss ripper software. it circumvents content scrambling system measures placed on dvds and let people make perfect digital copies of copyrighted dvds in minutes. those copies could then be burned onto a blank dvd or uploaded for exchange to a peer-to-peer network. macrovision said ripguard would also prevent against ""rent, rip and return"" - where people would rent a dvd, copy it and then return the original. ripguard is expected to be rolled out on dvds from the middle of 2005, the company said. the new system works specifically to block most ripping programs - if used, those programs will now most likely crash, the company said. macrovision has said that rip guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti-copying measures.

258,"hewitt decries 'career sexism'

plans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in labour's election manifesto, the trade and industry secretary has said.

patricia hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an ""increasingly high priority"" and a ""shared goal across government"". ms hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the equal opportunities commission (eoc). mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. ms hewitt told the seminar: ""clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. ""we are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.""

ms hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and ""taster courses"" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the equal opportunities commission (eoc).

the minister told delegates that getting rid of ""career sexism"" was vital to closing the gender pay gap.

""career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. ""it is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,"" she said. earlier, she told bbc radio 4's today programme: ""what we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. ""unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. ""career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. construction is even worse. ""but it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. career sexism goes both ways.""

she added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. ""the average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. for women working part-time it is 60p."" the department for trade and industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the tuc.

it has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. research conducted by the eoc last year revealed that many britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of ""natural differences"" between the sexes. women hold less than 10% of the top positions in ftse 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. and retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.

standard life is the latest shareholder in deutsche boerse to express concern at the german stock market operator's plans to buy the london stock exchange.

it said deutsche boerse had to show why its planned â£1.35bn ($2.5bn) offer for the lse was good for shareholder value. reports say standard life, which owns a 1% stake in deutsche boerse, may seek a shareholder vote on the issue. fellow shareholders us-based hedge fund atticus capital and uk-based tci fund management have also expressed doubts.

deutsche boerse's supervisory board has approved the possible takeover of the lse despite the signs of opposition from investors. ""the onus is on deutsche boerse's management to demonstrate why the purchase of the lse creates more value for shareholders than other strategies, such as a buyback,"" said richard moffat, investment director of uk equities at standard life investments. atticus capital, holding 2% of deutsche boerse, wants it to buy back its own shares rather than buy the lse. and tci which holds about 5%, has made a request for an extraordinary shareholders meeting to be held to vote on replacing the company's entire supervisory board. it has also demanded that shareholders be consulted about the proposed acquisition, and whether the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange should return $500m (â£266m) to shareholders instead.

in december, deutsche boerse, which also owns the derivatives market eurex and the clearing firm clearstream, put an informal offer of 530 pence per lse share on the table. however, the lse said the cash offer ""undervalued"" both its own business and the benefits of such a tie-up. since then an improved offer from deutsche boerse has been anticipated as its management has continued talks with lse chief executive clara furse. but the london exchange is also holding talks with deutsche boerse's rival euronext, which operates the amsterdam, brussels, lisbon and paris exchanges, as well as london-based international derivatives market liffe.

a next generation dvd technology backed by sony has received a major boost.

film giant disney says it will produce its future dvds using sony's blu-ray disc technology, but has not ruled out a rival format developed by toshiba. the two competing dvd formats, blu-ray developed by sony and others, and toshiba's hd-dvd, have been courting top film studios for several months. the next generation of dvds promises very high quality pictures and sound, as well as a lot of data. both technologies use a blue laser to write information. it has a shorter wavelength so more data can be stored. disney is the latest studio to announce which technology it is backing in a format battle which mirrors the 1980s betamax versus vhs war. sony lost out to jvc in that fight.

the current battle for hollywood's hearts and minds is a crucial one because high-definition films will bring in billions of revenue and the studios would prefer to use one standard. last month, paramount, universal and warner brothers said they were opting for the toshiba and nec-backed format, hd-dvd high-definition discs.

those studios currently produce about 45% of dvd content. sony pictures entertainment and mgm studios have already staked their allegiance with the blu-ray disc association, whose members also include technology companies dell, samsung and matsushita. twentieth century fox is still to announce which technology it will be supporting. if fox decided to go with blu-ray too, it would mean the format would have a 47% share of dvd content. disney said its films would be available on the blu-ray format when dvd players for the standard went on sale on north america and japan, expected in 2006. universal is to start producing films on the hd-dvd format in 2005, and paramount will start releasing titles using the standard in 2006. toshiba expects sales of hd-dvds to reach 300bn yen ($2.9bn, â£1.5bn) by 2010.

the 'bad behaviour' of e-mail users is helping to sustain the spam industry, a new study has found.

according to a survey conducted by security firm mirapoint and market research company the radicati group, nearly a third of e-mail users have clicked on links in spam messages. one in ten users have bought products advertised in junk mail. clicking on a link in a spam message can expose people to viruses and alert spammers to live e-mail accounts.

the fact that one in ten e-mail users are buying things advertised in spam continues to make it an attractive business, especially given that sending out huge amounts of spam costs very little, the report concludes. ""this preliminary data is surprising and somewhat shocking to us,"" said marcel nienhuis, market analyst at the radicati group. ""it explains why e-mail security threats including spam, viruses and phishing scams continue to proliferate,"" he said, accusing users of ""bad e-mail behaviour"". spammers are increasingly hooking into whatever happens to be flavour of the month, according to security firm clearswift. it has recently seen a rise in the number of spam messages offering phoney sony psp giveaways. and, in perhaps a nod to the popularity of the american drama series desperate housewives, it has also seen a dramatic rise in junk mails purporting to give details of women looking for casual sex. but rather than finding a companion, users who click on such mail will find themselves redirected to porn sites, where they run the risk of downloading spyware on to their pc. clearswift has seen a 180% rise in sex-related spam over the course of the last month. ""without casting aspersions, those likely to respond to these kind of adverts will be invariably hoping that 'one thing leads to another' but aside from the fact that these mails are bogus, clicking on any link within a spam mail can lead to a whole host of unwanted problems,"" said alyn hockey, clearswift's director of research.

sexually explicit terms make up 14% of security firm sophos' top 50 word that spammers most commonly try to disguise in order to beat anti-spam filters. spammers will deliberately misspell a word or use digits instead of letters in an attempt to by-pass anti-spam software, said graham cluley, senior technology consultant for security firm sophos. ""the list of words most commonly hidden by the spammers from anti-spam software reveals that most spam is about the old favourites: money, drugs and sex,"" said mr cluley. but anti-spam filters can only be part of the solution to the menace of junk e-mail. ""people must resist their basic instincts to buy from spam mails. spammers are criminals, plain and simple. if no-one responded to junk e-mail and didn't buy products sold in this way, then spam would be as extinct as the dinosaurs,"" he said.

us officials were talking up the dollar, they said, but failing to take action to back up their words. meeting in brussels, finance ministers of the 12 eurozone countries voiced their concern that the rise of the european currency was harming exports. the dollar is within touching distance of an all-time low reached earlier in november. at 0619 gmt on tuesday, the dollar was up slightly at just above $1.29 to the euro, and buying 105.6 yen in tokyo. it rallied briefly on monday amid signs that oil prices are easing.

but analysts said the respite was likely to be only temporary. the european ministers' comments, said junya tanase of jpmorgan chase bank in tokyo, were ""generally too weak to produce a market reaction"".

still, by the standards of diplomacy the european ministers were forthright. nicolas sarkozy of france said he and his colleagues were unanimous in their worry that the decline of the dollar would hit europe's economies by eating into their exports. ""we are concerned about these developments, which are destabilising, and which are linked to the accumulation of deficits by our american friends,"" he said. the comments come a day after us treasury secretary john snow said a strong dollar was ""in america's interest"".

but that was not enough for mr sarkozy.

""if the americans were to change their policy, it's up to them to say so,"" he said. and the european union's monetary affairs commissioner, made it clear that action was necessary. ""i fully welcome the words of mr snow,"" said joaquin almunia, ""but we will need to see decisions adopted in that direction. ""if the imbalances in the us economy are not adjusted in the future, the decision in the market will be as in the past weeks."" economists point out that whatever europe says, in the short term a weaker dollar is a boon to president george w bush's administration. not only does it boost us exports, but it also makes the budget deficit easier to fund. on the other hand, slower european exports would mean slower eu growth - potentially reducing the demand for us goods.

1414,"us 'to raise tv indecency fines'

us politicians are proposing a tough new law aimed at cracking down on indecency and bad language on us tv.

fines of up to $500,000 (â£266,582) could be imposed each time broadcasters transmit nudity or profanities. the proposal, unveiled in the house of representatives, also seeks to revoke a broadcaster's licence after three violations have been committed. the exposure of janet jackson's breast at last year's superbowl landed cbs with a $550,000 (â£293,264) fine. entertainers could also be liable for fines under the proposed legisation from both us politcians and officials from the federal communications commission (fcc). a republican senator from kansas, sam brownbeck, is set to call for a maximum $3 million (â£1.6 million) fine for repeated violations.

the current maximum fine stands at $32,500 (â£17,320) - 20 of the stations in the cbs network were each penalised these lesser amounts for the jackson incident. republican politician fred upton, who chairs the committee responsible for broadcasting, said current fines are ""more of a cost of doing business rather than a deterrent"". last year's janet jackson 'wardrobe malfunction' encouraged the fcc to impose tougher rules, but the us congress adjourned last year without agreeing on a new level of fines. new figures have to be decided before new legislation can be put before president bush. certain broadcasters, like fox, claim the material they carry does not violate indecency laws and is protected under the right to free speech.

boeing is to supply japan airlines with up to 50 of its forthcoming 7e7 planes in a deal that could be worth as much as $6bn (â£3.1bn) for the us giant.

japan airlines has made a firm order for 30 of the aircraft, at $120m each, with the option to buy 20 more. asia's biggest airline joins japanese rival all nippon as one of the first carriers to order the mid-size 7e7, which boeing says is super-economical. airbus this week announced the first pre-sale of its 7e7 rival - the a350. boeing's great european competitor is to sell 10 of its forthcoming a350 to spanish carrier air europe, which has the option to buy two more in a deal that could be worth more than $1.8bn. both the 7e7 and the a350 are being designed to be as fuel-efficient as possible in the 200- to 300-seat sector, and each will be available in both short and long range versions.

japan airlines said it had looked at both aircraft before choosing the 7e7, also known as the dreamliner. ""we chose the 7e7 after carefully considering both it and airbus' aircraft,"" said a japan airlines spokesman. ""the 7e7 fits better for what we needed and it could be delivered when we hoped to get it."" boeing continues to enjoy a dominance over airbus in japan, and japanese companies are taking key roles in building the 7e7. the first 7e7s will be delivered to japan airlines in april 2008. boeing has set itself a target of getting 200 firm commitments for the 7e7 by the end of this year, and has orders for 56 so far. airbus hopes to have 50 orders in place for the a350 by mid-2005.

969,"apple ipod family expands market

apple has expanded its ipod family with the release of its next generation of the digital music players.

its latest challenges to the growing digital music gadget market include an ipod mini model which can hold 6gb compared to a previous 4gb. the company, which hopes to keep its dominant place in the digital music market, also said the gold coloured version of the mini would be dropped. a 30gb version has also been added to the ipod photo family. the latest models have a longer battery life and their prices have been cut by an average of â£40. the original ipod took an early lead in the digital music player market thanks to its large storage capacity and simple design.

during 2004 about 25 million portable players were sold, 10 million of which were apple ipods. but analysts agree that the success is also down to its integration with the itunes online store, which has given the company a 70% share of the legal download music market. mike mcguire, a research director at analyst gartner, told the bbc news website that apple had done a good job in ""sealing off the market from competition"" so far. ""they have created a very seamless package which i think is the idea of the product - the design, function and the software are very impressive,"" he said. he added that the threat from others was always present, however. ""creative, other microsoft-partnered devices, real, sony and so on, are ratcheting up the marketing message and advertising,"" he said. creative was very upbeat about how many of its creative zen players it had shipped by the end of last year, he said. its second-generation models, like the creative zen micro photo, is due out in the summer. it will have 5gb of memory on board.

digital music players are now the gadget of choice among young americans, according to recent research by the pew internet and american life project. one in 10 us adults - 22 million people - now owns a digital music player of some sort. sales of legally downloaded songs also rose more than tenfold in 2004, according to the record industry, with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months. the ifpi industry body said that the popularity of portable music players was behind the growth. analysts say that the ease of use and growth of music services available on the net will continue to drive the trend towards portable music players.

people are also starting to use them in novel ways. some are combining automatic syncing functions many of them have with other net functions to automatically distribute diy radio shows, called podcasts. but 2005 will also see more competition from mobile phone operators who are keen to offer streaming services on much more powerful and sophisticated handsets. according to mr mcguire, research suggests that people like the idea of building up huge libraries of music, which they can do with high-capacity storage devices, like ipods and creative zens. mobiles do not yet have this capacity though, and there are issues about the ease of portability of mobile music. mr mcguire said apple was ensuring it kept a foot in the mobile music door with its recent deal with motorola to produce a version of itunes for motorola phones.

israel has asked a us banker and former international monetary fund director to run its central bank.

stanley fischer, vice chairman of banking giant citigroup, has agreed to take the bank of israel job subject to approval from parliament and cabinet. his nomination by prime minister ariel sharon came as a surprise, and led to gains on the tel aviv stock market. mr fischer, who speaks fluent hebrew, will have to become an israeli citizen to take the job. the us says he will not have to give up us citizenship to do so.

plasma display panels are used for large, thin tvs which are replacing old-style televisions. the display market for high-definition televisions is split between models using plasma display panels and others - manufactured by the likes of sony and samsung - using liquid-crystal displays (lcds). the deal will enable hitachi and matsushita, which makes panasonic brand products, to develop new technology and improve their competitiveness. hitachi recently announced a deal to buy plasma display technology from rival fujitsu in an effort to strengthen its presence in the market.

separately, fujitsu announced on monday that it is quitting the lcd panel market by transferring its operations in the area to japanese manufacturer sharp. sharp will inherit staff, manufacturing facilities and intellectual property from fujitsu. the plasma panel market has seen rapid consolidation in recent months as the price of consumer electronic goods and components has fallen. samsung electronics and sony are among other companies working together to reduce costs and speed up new product development.

voters will have a clear choice between the politics of fear and the politics of hope in the next general election, said charles kennedy.

in his new year message the liberal democrat leader said labour and the conservatives were united in relying on fear and ""populist scares"". he said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a 2005 poll. on the asian tsunami he said it had been ""very heartening"" to learn of the generosity being shown by britons. mr kennedy said his thoughts were with all those caught up in the disaster, which had dominated the christmas and new year period. at home he said many people were turning to the liberal democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties.

the general election would be a three-party struggle, as the conservative party ""fades away"" as a national force and the liberal democrats challenge labour in its heartlands, he said.

""labour is counting on the politics of fear, ratcheting up talk of threats, crime and insecurity. while the conservatives are re-working their populist scares about asylum and the european 'menace',"" he said. he said the government was using this climate of fear to try to strip away civil liberties.

it was already using detention without trial at belmarsh prison, ignoring a recent law lords judgement that this contravenes basic human rights, he said. he also criticised attempts to bring in trial without jury, plans to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials, curbing of rights to protest, increased stop and search powers and id card plans. he said while everyone had the right to be secure they also had the right to be protected against unfair discrimination.

1967,"italy to get economic action plan

italian prime minister silvio berlusconi will unveil plans aimed at kickstarting the country's sputtering economy on thursday night in rome.

he will present an ""action plan for the development of italy"" in a meeting with industrialists and trade union leaders. mr berlusconi is expected to table reforms aimed at boosting research and development (r&d) spending, and the competitiveness of small firms. also in focus will be bankruptcy laws and the slow pace of the legal system. the prime minister is scheduled to start the meeting at 1830 gmt.

the government has been accused of underfunding r&d, making it harder for italy to compete with other european nations and leading to a ""brain-drain"" of the country's brightest talents. analysts say that hiring and firing staff is still too difficult and expensive, hampering the development of small- and medium-sized businesses. as a result, they say, italy's corporate landscape is filled with numerous smaller companies that are often reluctant to become bigger because of all the extra hassle that would accompany the running of a larger firm. at the same time, bankruptcy laws make it difficult for failed company directors to set up new businesses and emerge from their debts, a situation that is hampering italy's entrepreneurial spirit.

the government says that it has set about tackling the problems, adding that getting growth going was the responsibility of all of italy's 60 million population. according to il sole 24 ore, italy's business newspaper, the government will focus on ""opening up markets, infrastructure, research, making more incentives available, bankruptcy law, the slow pace of the justice system"".

mr berlusconi has previously promised to cut taxes by 6.5bn euros ($8.6bn; â£4.5bn) this year in an effort to get people and companies to spend. he has also promised to cap spending on transport, education and health so as to trim the ballooning budget deficit. italy plans to raise as much as 25bn euros from privatisations in 2005, including a partial flotation of the post office and utility enel. critics argue that these moves do not go far enough and could make italy's problems worse. limiting government spending will lead to job losses, they counter, while the income tax cuts will have a negligible effect on sentiment and ultimately favour the wealthy.

the country has been one of the eurozone's worst economic performers in recent years. growth was 1.1% in 2004, up from just 0.3% in 2003 and 0.4% in 2002 - an improvement but still a long way from ideal. at the same time, business and consumer confidence has dipped and analysts have raised concerns that what little spending there is stems from italians dipping into their savings accounts or using credit cards. without a pick up in national growth, they say, the money could eventually run out, bringing italy's economy to a juddering halt. consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of italy's economy.

he said the producers would not achieve their aim of re-engaging voters ""with that bunch of nutters"". to give sir bernard his dues, monday evening's opening episode did attract more than a smattering of eccentrics and self-publicists. among those chancing their arm were a druid priest and a former porn star, who insisted on removing her top to make her point about the legalisation of brothels. among the more eccentric policy proposals was a public holiday on bruce forsyth's birthday and bill oddie for prime minister. the show follows the time-honoured pop idol format, with queues of nervous hopefuls and a panel of three experts judging their performance.

the contestants were given 60 seconds to present their manifestos. then the final 25 were tested on their lobbying ability. they were then cross-examined by the panel, which was chaired by ex-itn political editor john sergeant, with television host lorraine kelly taking the nicki chapman role. but the real star of the show is kelvin mackenzie, in the simon cowell, mr nasty seat.

the former sun editor dispensed a stream of well-crafted insults and one-liners. his advice for one young contestant was to ""get a haircut and a brain transplant"". wheelchair user kevin donnellon was asked: ""why on earth do you want our elected representatives to be disabled?"" ""don't you care about the inuit?"", implored guitar-toting environmental campaigner barry lim. ""i don't care about them. i care about myself and when the sun's shining i think - fantastic,"" replied mr mackenzie.

mr lim later reduced the panel to fits of giggles as he outlined his plan to make people do community service instead of paying taxes. ""when the prime minister turns to the chancellor and says how much have we got in the coffers mr brown, he says well, prime minister, bad news, all the houses in britain have been painted but actually nobody has paid any tax,"" observed mr mackenzie. ""that was an total disaster. i just couldn't seem to think of things to say,"" a crestfallen mr lim confided in the show's presenter, jonathan maitland. irfan hanif, a 25-year-old doctor from bolton, made a good impression, even if he was a little thrown by mr mackenzie's suggestion that instead of being treated by the nhs, young drunks should ""given a good beating"" and left to die. dominic carman - son of late libel lawyer george carman - was voted through to the final 25, on a platform of cutting defence spending to boost education. opinion was more divided over rodney hylton-potts, a 59-year-old convicted fraudster. mr mackenzie thought the smooth-talking former solicitor - with a hardline on crime and immigration - deserved a chance to progress. ""he could join the rest of the crooks in the houses of parliament."" but ms kelly said she ""would not trust him as far as she could throw him"". the series continues throughout the week, with the public given the chance to evict one prospective mp every night. itv will not fund the election campaign for the eventual winner, but the publicity could give the winner a flying start over other candidates.

1238,"swap offer for pirated windows xp

computer giant microsoft has launched a pilot scheme to replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones.

the first-time initiative is restricted to the uk and to users with pre-installed copies of the operating system in pcs bought before november. until december microsoft said software can be sent to it for analysis if there are doubts about its legitimacy. the company aims to detect illegal traders and turn users of fake versions of windows into legitimate ones.

the windows xp counterfeit project will mean that software that is found to be counterfeit will be replaced for free, subject to certain conditions, until the end of the year. it is the first time microsoft has launched a counterfeit product replacement scheme in the world, the company told the bbc news website. in june, the software giant said that the major security update to windows xp, service pack 2, would not work with the most widely pirated versions of its operating system. the upgrade closed security loopholes in xp and added features that made it easier to keep machines safe from viruses and other types of malicious computer code.

the us company invited anyone who had suspicions about their version of windows xp to submit it for testing as soon as possible. the procedure consists of a series of computer checks, collating documents, and filling out a witness statement. ""this is a great opportunity for users to confirm the authenticity of windows xp software whilst helping gather vital information about illegal traders"", said alex hilton, licence compliance manager at microsoft. the scheme has also been welcomed by the technology and commerce industry. ""it is important that users ensure that they are legally licensed to avoid the risks of purchasing and using counterfeit products"", said david frost, director general of the british chambers of commerce. the plan would enable microsoft to gather intelligence about illegal traders in a prompt way, which would allow it to take action against software pirates. microsoft said it would evaluate the results of the uk programme before setting up similar schemes in other countries.

1078,"losing yourself in online gaming

online role playing games are time-consuming, but enthralling flights from reality. but are some people taking their fantasy lives too seriously?

when video game world of warcraft hit the shops in europe last week fans wrote in to the bbc website to express their delight - and to offer a warning. ""an addiction to a game like this is far more costly in time than any substance could impair - keep track of time,"" wrote travis anderson, in texas. some of the comments were humorous: ""this game is so good i'm not going to get it, there's no way i could limit the hours i'd spend playing it,"" wrote charles macintyre, from england.

but some struck a more worrying tone about the massively multiplayer online role playing game (mmorpg): ""'you need to get out more' could be the motto of any mmorpg. shame they are getting more popular, as you know this problem is just going to mushroom,"" wrote stuart stanton-davies, in huddersfield. scare-mongering articles about ""addictive video games"" have existed since the days the first game of pong stopped everyone from working at the atari offices.

gaming is like any other pastime - it can quickly become an unhealthy obsession, whether it is spending too much time in the gym, in front of the television, or reading poetry.

unfortunately, gaming and addiction is a far too easy association to make. however, stories about gamers spending 10 to 15 hours a day in front of some video games are becoming more frequent. and the impact that is having on their families is quite distressing for some.

massively multiplayer online role playing games - mmorpgs - allow thousands of gamers to share a common experience of sharing fantasy or science fiction worlds. the scope of these games - like warcraft, everquest, ultima among others - is epic, and exploration and adventure is almost infinite. part of the ""problem"" is grinding - by which gamers have to perform long-winded, mindless tasks, to bring up their levels and gain access to more adventure. such open-endedness brings with it a desire to keep playing; not for no reason is everquest (eq) nicknamed evercrack. e hayot, writing in the culture blogzine print culture, said recently: ""i used to play the online role-playing game everquest a lot. ""by 'a lot', i mean probably 15 to 20 hours a week on average, and on weeks where i didn't have to work, as many as 30 or 40 hours.""

he says that in the world of online gaming such behaviour ""wasn't that unusual; lots of people i knew in the game played eq that much"". ""you lie; you don't go into work because you ""had stuff to do at home""; you cancel or refuse invitations to dinner, you spend much less time watching tv (a good thing, presumably),"" he wrote, explaining how everquest took over his time. he quit the game, he says, because he realised life was more fun than everquest.

let us be clear - such obsession is rare. but the huge growth in online gaming means a growth in the numbers of people who take their passion for a hobby too far. almost 400,000 people bought a copy of world of warcraft in the first two days on sale earlier this month. only a fraction will descend into obsessives. the thoughts of families and friends of gamers who have been affected by everquest can be found on one blog everquest daily grind. jane, who runs the website, compiles a chronicle of heart-rending stories. ""i am actually convinced at this point that there are more than 'some' people who spend more times in mmoprgs than in reality,"" she said. one unnamed correspondent - all are anonymous - wrote: ""on the rare nights when my husband does come to bed at the same time as i do, i find that i am so used to sleeping by myself that it is difficult to get to sleep with another body laying next to me.

""i can't talk to him while he is playing. there is absolutely no point as he doesn't hear me or is so distracted that i get a 'ummm... ya' a few minutes after i ask him a question.""

""gaming widows"" has become a comedic term for women who have been shut out by male gamers. but for some it is not in the least funny. another correspondent wrote: ""i believe that he is addicted to the online gaming, and that is the cause of his depression and restlessness."" and some of them are even sadder: ""today our son was five days old. ""the sad truth is my husband spent 11 hours today playing his warcraft game. he did not interact with our sweet tiny baby because there were important quests waiting online."" video game fans often complain that their hobby is misunderstood or marginalised. but as gaming becomes ever more mainstream, and games ever more immersive, there will be no hiding place for social problems.



i wish 30-40 hours a week was unusual but i think it probably isn't. an 11 hour stretch isn't that surprising - i've known people to play 15+ hours at a stretch. i know of people who are spending their week's holiday from work playing warcraft. i know of people who would play ever[crack] in shifts...waking at 3am to take over from their friends and resume waiting for an item they 'needed' to appear. i understand that the key sign of an addiction is if you alter your life around it rather than fit it into your life. by all standards many of us are addicts. so is the solution to force ourselves to stop playing..or do we just need to make real life a bit more interesting?

sadly with all the talk of people becoming obsessed with gaming, i find myself longing to have the time to join them. i have been in a long term relationship for over 4 years - since that began, games have become more and more complex. and more and more so i find i have less and less time to play them, with and marriage and work being the main drag on my time.

i think the line between playing a game a lot and a gaming addiction is really quite distinct. i play games a lot, definately over 20 hours a week, but i don't go missing work or other commitments in order to play games.

i have, about a year ago, deleted every game on my computer. rpgs are the worst - the real world fades and all your worries sorround a new magic staff or mighty sword. unlike books, or perhaps even tv, you gain absolutely nothing. when you stop playing you're at the same point as when you started; all the achievements of your 10 hour session are irretrievably locked in the game and, since you've gained nothing in the real world, you may as well pile on more achievement in the fake one.

despite having little monetary value, the ""rewards"" and encouragement offered by these mmorpgs is enough to hook games for hours daily. if only business could learn to leverage that very simply human need for easily measurable progress and recognition. perhaps the unhealthily obsessed simply need more recognition for their achievements in reality?

my advice to gaming widows is ""if you can't beat 'em, join 'em"". that is, try playing it yourself. if he wants to play as well, well at least you'll be together somewhere...

i was an addict and it cost me my relationship. i still play now, but without the guilt , hehe, how long have i played in one sitting? from morning till the early hours of the next day, the birds were singing out side and i had to hobble to the bath room cos my bladder was so full i was in pain, i would hardly eat, perhaps some toast, smoke endlessly and drink. now, thankfully the fascination has worn off and i have a girlfriend but still no job. for the most part online gaming give me an adiction to illusory achievement, and as there is no end in sight you keep going for the mirage of the ultimate.

obsessive behaviour is, of course, always cause for concern, but it always bothers me when articles about gaming talk in terms of ""reality"". obviously, somebody who spends thirty hours a week playing everquest has a problem. this problem, however, has nothing to do with a dysfunctional sense of reality. an obsessive eq player does not consider the game to be ""real"" any more than - for example - an obsessive automotive tinkerer considers their car to be human. if mmorpgs have a unique danger, in terms of encouraging obsessive behaviour, it is not that they create an absorbing virtual world, but rather that they can be easily accessed 24/7. the problem here does not lie with the nature of gaming, but with the nature of modern 24 hour culture.

the problem with these so called mmorpgs is that you can never really complete them, there's always another quest to do. a few of my friends have only had about 10 hours sleep since it was released friday...

championship manager consumed my life for years. one particular session started at about 2pm on a sunday, paused for a brief sleep at 5am on the monday and after visit to university for classes restarted at about midday for another 10 hour session. the people who tend to hark on about about the problems of ""hardcore gaming"" seem to be those who have rarely allowed themselves to become immersed in a game. i would expect their perspective to change if they were to do that.

i used to be an everquest addict while i was in college. it came to the point where the gaming world felt more real than the real one. i failed alot of my courses and was able to barely graduate. i was lucky that i came to my senses when i did, others were less fortunate and dropped out of college. now that i am holding a job, i avoid online rpgs like the plague.

when i was made redundant i told my partner i had a new job for three months whilst every day i played everquest from 7:30am till 5:pm. when she came home i pretended i had just got in as well, hence justifying playing it all evening. i have since quit playing mmorpg and have a good job.

when i got to the point where i was eating my dinner in front of the pc i realised things were getting silly so i'm trying not to spend so much time on there. it's not easy. i feel as if i've got a real addiction going on here.

for me the problem is that i love to complete a goal. once it is completed that is it, i am finished, time to move on. i become obsessed to complete the goal, so from that standpoint it is an addiction. in a game where you will never complete an ""ultimate"" goal, well it would be like falling into a black pit. it is easier to escape into a controlled fantasy world than face reality at times - in other words the goal offered in the pc game are ""easier"" and more fun than the real world. pretty scary implications if you think about it.

i can't buy world of warcraft as it would destroy my marrage, i just know it!!

i played star wars galaxies for about a year and can attest to the addictiveness of these games. they are all engineered in such a way that early on in the game you progress quickly, but this progress becomes exponentially slower, requiring more and more time to reach the next level. i'm sad to say that at the peak of my addiction i was spending entire weekends in front of my monitor, slowly building up my character, stopping only for food and toilet breaks. thankfully i made a clean break, and actually managed to sell my jedi account for â£800 - which is my only sanity check in an otherwise completely unproductive time vacuum.

seven years ago, i began playing ultima online. this game dominated 2 years of my life. they were 2 wonderful years and i still have vivid memories of the experiences and friends i had. online gaming can be a world of escapism where you can be yourself without fear of the thoughts of others. something that cannot always be achieved in the day to day running of a normal life. whilst i would warn against people giving to much of there life to these games, i believe they are a better way to spend your time than say watching tv.

gaming is addictive and should be made a recognised addiction. when i was single i used to play upto eight hours a night after work every night for about a year, building up my stats, completing evermore quests and battling ogres. but somehow i found time to get out, even met someone and got married! has my life changed? hell no! i still cast spells and battle till the early hours of the morning. on with the fun!

online gaming should be enjoyed just as much as you would enjoy watching television, or going to the cinema or the pub with your mates.

many people use recreational drugs on an occasional basis and are able to lead succesfull lives with families, relationships and good careers. a minority allow drugs to take over and destroy their lives and become addicted. according to this article the same is true of mmorpgs. the message to the government is clear, either legalise drugs, or outlaw online gaming!!

sounds like there are some sad stories here - and i can believe them all. i play alot of warcraft myself, and know full well how addictive it is. i am resolute that it will not take over my life. it certainly gets in the way though. i think that some people simply do not know how to draw this line, or lack the willpower to stop themselves stepping over it.

i think i'm obsessed with gaming in general, i spend far too much time playing games like everquest 2 and football manager rather than going out and interacting with real people and when i do try to, i'm always thinking in the back if my mind that i'd rather be in front of the computer winning the league with cambridge united.

i am obsessed with online role playing games. it's not so much quests but it has the adrenaline of a real life situation - goals to achieve etc. i spend about five hours per day online playing it and i rarely get more than four to five hours sleep before getting up for work the next morning...

as many of the players spend their time in mmorpgs rather than in front of the tv i fail to see how it will affect players social lives negatively. furthermore these types of games contain a huge social aspect, whereas other games and some other pursuits (such as being a couch potato) the players could be indulging in are solitary by nature.

these games are like most things -- too much of anything is a bad thing, but as long as you can walk away from the computer to do other things too, they can be great fun.

living in korea at the moment, they have lots pc bangs (internet cafes). nearly most of south koreans are addicted to online games, and one korean died because of the lack of food and water he had through playing online games.

i play xbox live every day. i find my self lying and rescheduling everything around my gaming fix. the longest i played was a 24 hour straight session. i know i play for to long but it's an obsession that i can't control. can you reccomend a counsellor - this is not a wind up... but something i'm increasingly concerned with...

me and my mate play online for an hour or two a day, we're both aware of how much time can disappear by sitting in front of a tv, trying to 'frag' some individual. it's getting the balance between getting home and relasing the stress of a day by an hour or so gaming, and enjoying 'real' life...

i bought the us version of world of warcraft when it came out. the longest period i played was 23 hrs straight. i gave up the game after a month because it was so addictive, but have subsequently just bought the european version (couldn't help myself). in future, i'm going to regulate my time far more strictly. great game!

having played mmorpg games for some years i agree that these type of games can be life sucking. but my concern is for the younger generation of gamers that play for hours on end in an adult enviroment. most mmorpg games you need a credit card to play but i dont think parents know just what they are letting there children into.

unless there is undeniable medical proof that staring at a computer screens for hours at a time can damage a person&#191;s health, you can expect this not to decline but to get worse.

these people are pathetic. they need to get off their machines and notice that our world is being swiftly overcome by issues and troubles that make the trifling worries of and ""online universe"" absolutely meaningless.

2004,"diageo to buy us wine firm

diageo, the world's biggest spirits company, has agreed to buy californian wine company chalone for $260m (â£134m) in an all-cash deal.

although diageo's best-known brands include smirnoff vodka and guinness stout, it already has a us winemaking arm - diageo chateau & estate wines. diageo said it expects to get us regulatory approval for the deal during the first quarter of 2005. it said chalone would be integrated into its existing us wine business.

""the us wine market represents a growth opportunity for diageo, with favourable demographic and consumption trends,"" said diageo north america president ivan menezes. in july, diageo, which is listed on the london stock exchange, reported an annual turnover of â£8.89bn, down from â£9.28bn a year earlier. it blamed a weaker dollar for its lower turnover. in the year ending 31 december 2003, chalone reported revenues of $69.4m.

gordon brown has doubled the level at which house buyers pay stamp duty to â£120,000 as he put the economy at the heart of labour's election campaign.

the chancellor also unveiled a one-off â£200 council tax refund for pensioners and a rise in child tax credit. mr brown put 1p a pint on beer, 4p on a bottle of wine and 7p on 20 cigarettes but froze petrol duty until september. the tories called it a ""vote now, pay later"" budget. the lib dems branded it a ""sticking plaster"" for the election.

tory leader michael howard predicted the budget would do nothing to help labour's ""faltering"" election campaign.

""this government and this chancellor have run out of solutions to the problems britain faces,"" mr howard told mps. ""their only answer is to tax, to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later."" he ended his response with an election challenge to labour, saying ""bring it on"". liberal democrat leader charles kennedy attacked mr brown for failing to mention the environment and for his record on social justice. ""how can it be right in britain today that the poorest 20% pay more in tax, as a proportion of their income, than the richest 20%?"" he asked.

mr kennedy criticised mr brown for failing to mention the ""ticking bomb"" of council tax revaluation, saying it was ""high time"" the system was replaced by a ""local tax based on the ability to pay"". during his 49 minute speech mr brown told mps he had defied the pundits by hitting his growth target of 3.1% for 2004.

he said his budget struck a balance ""between tax cuts that are affordable, investments that are essential and stability that is paramount"". he rejected across-the-board tax cuts in favour of targeted help for families. the child tax credit will rise in line with earnings, giving families an extra â£5 a week. in contrast, the personal income tax allowance will rise only in line with inflation from â£4,745 to â£4,895 next month. mr brown told mps child benefit would rise to a maximum of â£63 a week for the first child and â£111 for two children. despite his giveaways, budget documents show mr brown clawed back â£265m through a clampdown on tax avoidance and increased revenue from a windfall tax on oil companies. he also scrapped stamp duty relief for commercial property in disadvantaged areas - a measure brought in just over three years ago. bbc political editor andrew marr suggested the sweeteners were not big enough to have a transforming effect on voters. but trust in mr brown's economic stewardship would be a central election issue, he said.

mr brown also unveiled plans for a memorial to the queen mother, funded through a special coin to celebrate the queen's 80th birthday. other measures include equal tax status for same-sex couples and a deal with the council of mortgage lenders to boost low cost home ownership. the level where people start paying inheritance tax will also rise from â£263,000 to â£275,000 from april. mr brown said he had met his financial ""golden rule"" with a â£6bn surplus and he said public borrowing would continue to fall over the next five years.

the economy had grown for 50 consecutive quarters, he said, and was forecast to continue doing so over the next year, with a forecast of 3% to 3.5% in 2005 and 2.5% to 3% in 2006. the first â£2bn of value-for-money savings identified in the gershon review have been achieved, the chancellor said. some 12,500 civil servant posts have been axed, and 7,800 relocated out of the south east of england, he added. snp leader alex salmond said mr brown had failed the ""tartan test"" as there were no measures to boost the scottish economy. simon thomas, of plaid cymru, called it a budget for middle england. uk independence party leader roger knapman attacked the plans for pensioners saying they needed ""more money and the dignity of being allowed to spend it how they want,"" not ""free bus rides"". the green party said the budget was a ""wasted opportunity"" for environmental protection, adding: ""brown obviously has an eye on the coming election, and has taken his eye off the needs of the planet.""

692,"man utd stroll to cup win

wayne rooney made a winning return to everton as manchester united cruised into the fa cup quarter-finals.

rooney received a hostile reception, but goals in each half from quinton fortune and cristiano ronaldo silenced the jeers at goodison park. fortune headed home after 23 minutes before ronaldo scored when nigel martyn parried paul scholes' free-kick. marcus bent missed everton's best chance when roy carroll, who was later struck by a missile, saved at his feet.

rooney's return was always going to be a potential flashpoint, and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick-off. and rooney's every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19-year-old. everton started brightly and fortune needed to be alert to scramble away a header from bent near the goal-line. but that was the cue for united to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a goodison park pitch that was cutting up. fortune gave united the lead after 23 minutes, rising to meet ronaldo's cross from eight yards after the portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless gary naysmith. united dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances, and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time. mikel arteta played a superb ball into the area but bent, played onside by gabriel heintze, hesitated and carroll plunged at his fee to save. united almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when ronaldo's low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off tony hibbert, but martyn dived to save brilliantly. and martyn came to everton's rescue three minutes later when rooney's big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through, but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form. but there was nothing martyn could do when united doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage. scholes' free-kick took a deflection, and martyn could only parry the ball out for ronaldo, who reacted first to score easily. everton's problems worsened when james mcfadden limped off with an injury. and there may be further trouble ahead for everton after goalkeeper carroll required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal. rooney's desperate search for a goal on his return to everton was halted again by martyn in injury-time when he outpaced stubbs, but once again martyn denied the england striker.

115,"plaid mp's cottage arson claim

a plaid cymru mp believes uk security services were involved in some arson attacks blamed on welsh extremists.

it is 25 years since the start of 12 years of fire-bombings, attributed to a shadowy group known as meibion glyndwr. plaid cymru's elfyn llwyd has suggested the security services could have been involved, with the intention of discrediting the nationalist vote. ex-welsh office minister lord roberts of conwy denied security services were involved. in march this year, north wales police reopened the case, saying materials kept during their investigations would be examined to find whether it would yield dna evidence.

meibion glyndwr - which means ""sons of glyndwr"" - began burning property in december 1979 in protest at homes in rural wales being sold as holiday cottages to people from england. the group was linked to most of the 220 or so fire-bombing incidents stretching from the llyn peninsula to pembrokeshire. the campaign continued until the early 1990s. police were accused in some quarters of targeting anyone who was a nationalist. although one man, sion aubrey roberts, was convicted in 1993 of sending letter bombs in the post, the arson cases remain unsolved.

as a solicitor, elfyn llwyd represented welsh singer bryn f&#244;n when he was arrested on suspicion of being involved in the arson campaign. f&#244;n was released without charge . but now, as mp for merionnydd nant conwy and plaid cymru's parliamentary leader, mr llwyd has argued that some of the terror attacks may have had the involvement of the security services and not meibion glyndwr. he believes that elements of the british security services may have carried out renegade actions in order to discredit plaid cymru and the nationalist vote ahead of elections. the claim is made in an interview for bbc wales' maniffesto programme to be shown on s4c on sunday.

mr llwyd said that the sophistication of many of the devices used in the attacks compared to the crude nature of many others, suggests a degree of professionalism which could only have come from individuals who knew exactly what they were doing. he said: ""what i'm saying is that the role that they took wasn't the appropriate one, i.e. like an

agent provocateur

and perhaps interfering and creating a situation where it looked like it was the nationalists that were responsible."" the programme also heard from lord roberts of conwy, who was a welsh office minister at the time. he denied that the security services played any improper role. mr llwyd's theory has also been questioned by plaid cymru's former president, dafydd wigley. he accepted that the fires damaged plaid cymru's public image but believed that the security services had their hands full at the time with the ira and animal rights activists.

0,"budget to set scene for election

gordon brown will seek to put the economy at the centre of labour's bid for a third term in power when he delivers his ninth budget at 1230 gmt. he is expected to stress the importance of continued economic stability, with low unemployment and interest rates. the chancellor is expected to freeze petrol duty and raise the stamp duty threshold from â£60,000. but the conservatives and lib dems insist voters face higher taxes and more means-testing under labour.

treasury officials have said there will not be a pre-election giveaway, but mr brown is thought to have about â£2bn to spare.

- increase in the stamp duty threshold from â£60,000 
 - a freeze on petrol duty 
 - an extension of tax credit scheme for poorer families 
 - possible help for pensioners the stamp duty threshold rise is intended to help first time buyers - a likely theme of all three of the main parties' general election manifestos. ten years ago, buyers had a much greater chance of avoiding stamp duty, with close to half a million properties, in england and wales alone, selling for less than â£60,000. since then, average uk property prices have more than doubled while the starting threshold for stamp duty has not increased. tax credits as a result, the number of properties incurring stamp duty has rocketed as has the government's tax take. the liberal democrats unveiled their own proposals to raise the stamp duty threshold to â£150,000 in february.

the tories are also thought likely to propose increased thresholds, with shadow chancellor oliver letwin branding stamp duty a ""classic labour stealth tax"". the tories say whatever the chancellor gives away will be clawed back in higher taxes if labour is returned to power. shadow treasury chief secretary george osborne said: ""everyone who looks at the british economy at the moment says there has been a sharp deterioration in the public finances, that there is a black hole,"" he said. ""if labour is elected there will be a very substantial tax increase in the budget after the election, of the order of around â£10bn.""

but mr brown's former advisor ed balls, now a parliamentary hopeful, said an examination of tory plans for the economy showed there would be a â£35bn difference in investment by the end of the next parliament between the two main parties. he added: ""i don't accept there is any need for any changes to the plans we have set out to meet our spending commitments.""

for the lib dems david laws said: ""the chancellor will no doubt tell us today how wonderfully the economy is doing,"" he said. ""but a lot of that is built on an increase in personal and consumer debt over the last few years - that makes the economy quite vulnerable potentially if interest rates ever do have to go up in a significant way."" snp leader alex salmond said his party would introduce a â£2,000 grant for first time buyers, reduce corporation tax and introduce a citizens pension free from means testing. plaid cymru's economics spokesman adam price said he wanted help to get people on the housing ladder and an increase in the minimum wage to â£5.60 an hour.

22,"labour accused of 'eu propaganda'

a ""taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise"" on the eu is being used to lull the british public into a false sense of security, say the tories.

shadow foreign secretary michael ancram told mps a new white paper was part of trying to soften up opinion ahead of the referendum on the eu constitution. his claims were denied by foreign secretary jack straw, who accused the tories of ""running scared"" of debate. eu cooperation would help get better uk immigration controls, he argued.

mr straw used thursday's commons debate to launch the new white paper on the prospects for the eu in 2005. security, stability and prosperity would be the key themes when the uk took over the chairmanship of the eu in july, said mr straw. africa and climate change would also feature highly. he said the uk was trying to ensure future eu budgets were limited to 1% of europe's economic output and were spent ""where it adds most value"". mr straw promised to continue to ensure the uk's budget rebate, secured in 1984 by margaret thatcher, was ""fully justified"". ""we, like all other countries, have a veto on any changes proposed in this area,"" he said.

mr ancram condemned the document, which the foreign office says has cost about â£2,500 to design, print and deliver. ""isn't the reason that the government is now involved in a taxpayer subsidised propaganda exercise to try to sell the new eu to the country in advance of the forthcoming referendum and general election?,"" he asked. the tory spokesman also criticised the government for claiming the eu constitution would make europe easier to understand. ""the government, last week, had to publish a commentary of 500 pages to try and explain this 'easy and simple' constitution to the british people,"" he said. ""who are they trying to kid?"" the proposed question for the constitution referendum is: ""should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union?"" the electoral commission on thursday said it was satisfied the question was easy to understand. the government has suggested the referendum on the constitution could take place in spring 2006, with the tories set to campaign for a ""no"" vote.

mr ancram said ministers were prolonging uncertainty by putting the vote off until the latest date possible. the foreign secretary hit back by saying tory attitudes to europe had helped keep the party out of power for more than a decade. mr straw argued cooperation with european partners could bring a ""level playing field"" on immigration and asylum controls. ""you are setting your face against all of these things,"" he added. for the liberal democrats, sir menzies campbell said the uk should not ignore the need to reform the eu common agricultural policy. change was particularly important for developing countries wanting access to markets, he argued. sir menzies was among those worried about plans, backed by the uk, to lift the arms embargo imposed on china after the tiananmen square massacre. mr straw said no decisions had been taken - chinese human rights had improved but not by enough.

1817,"ban on forced retirement under 65

employers will no longer be able to force workers to retire before 65, unless they can justify it.

the government has announced that firms will be barred from 2006 from imposing arbitrary retirement ages. under new european age discrimination rules, a default retirement age of 65 will be introduced. workers will be permitted to request staying on beyond this compulsory retirement age, although employers will have the right to refuse. trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt said people would not be forced to work longer than they wanted, saying the default age was not a statutory, compulsory retirement age. she said employers would be free to continue employing people for as long as they were competent.

under age discrimination proposals from the department of trade and industry last year workers were to be allowed to work on till 70 if they wished.

business leaders had opposed the plan as they said it would be too costly and cumbersome. the british chambers of commerce welcomed the latest proposal. ""this move today is the best of both worlds,"" it said. ""employers have the ability to define the end point of the employer-employee relationship and employees have flexibility with a right to request to work past the age of 65."" but age concern said imposing a retirement age of 65 was ""cowardly"" and a ""complete u-turn"".

1324,"sun offers processing by the hour

sun microsystems has launched a pay-as-you-go service which will allow customers requiring huge computing power to rent it by the hour.

sun grid costs users $1 (53p) for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on systems maintained by sun. so-called grid computing is the latest buzz phrase in a company which believes that computing capacity is as important a commodity as hardware and software. sun likened grid computing to the development of electricity.

the system could mature in the same way utilities such as electricity and water have developed, said sun's chief operating officer jonathan schwartz. ""why build your own grid when you can use ours for a buck an hour?"" he asked in a webcast launching sun's quarterly network computing event in california. the company will have to persuade data centre managers to adopt a new model but it said it already had interest from customers in the oil, gas and financial services industries.

some of them want to book computing capacity of more than 5,000 processors each, sun said. mr schwartz ran a demonstration of the service, showing how data could be processed in a protein folding experiment. hundreds of servers were used simultaneously, working on the problem for a few seconds each.

although it only took a few seconds, the experiment cost $12 (â£6.30) because it had used up 12 hours' worth of computing power. the sun grid relies on solaris, the operating system owned by sun. initially it will house the grid in existing premises and will use idle servers to test software before shipping it to customers. it has not said how much the system will cost to develop but it already has a rival in ibm, which argues that its capacity on-demand service is cheaper than that offered by sun.

1428,"arthur hailey: king of the bestsellers

novelist arthur hailey, who has died at the age of 84, was known for his bestselling page-turners exploring the inner workings of various industries, from the hotels to high finance.

born in luton, bedfordshire, on 5 april 1920, hailey was the only child of working class parents, they could not afford to keep him in school beyond the age of 14. he served as a pilot with the royal air force during world war ii, flying fighter planes to the middle east. it was an occupation that was later to feature in his authorial debut, the television screenplay flight into danger. hailey emigrated to canada in 1947, where he eventually became a citizen. he wanted to be a writer from an early age, but did not take it up professionally until his mid-thirties, when he was inspired to write his first screenplay while on a return flight to toronto.

""i fell to daydreaming. i visualised the pilots at the controls and wondered what would happen if they both got sick. could i fly the airplane? i was a rusty wartime pilot who hadn't flown for nine years... "" hailey later recalled. the canadian broadcasting corporation bought flight into danger for $600 (â£318) and it was shown on tv in april 1956. it was later memorably spoofed in the 1980 comedy airplane!, starring leslie nielsen. hailey worked as a screenwriter for a couple of years, before turning to novels. he went on to produce 11 best-selling books, which were published into 38 languages in 40 countries. flight into danger was adapted to become hailey's first novel, runaway zero-eight in 1958. the final diagnosis and in high places followed, both achieving a popular following. but it was not until hotel, in 1965, that hollywood came calling. the hit novel took four years to write, and stayed on national best-seller lists for a full year. it was turned into a movie in 1967 and later adapted into a glossy soap in the 1980s, starring james brolin. airport (1968) arguably remains hailey's best-loved work and prompted the disaster movie genre. the thriller follows events in the sky, and on the ground at a snow-logged airport, when a terrorist boards an airplane with a bomb.

the book was adapted into a hit film in 1970, starring burt lancaster as the harassed aiport manager and dean martin as a womanising pilot, alongside jean seberg and jacqueline bisset. in a testament to the popularity of the fledgling disaster genre - three sequels followed. the writer was known for his painstaking research into the professions around which each novel was centred, drawing his characters ""from real life"" and taking up to three years to produce each book. ""i have never been able to write quickly or easily. i am too self-critical for that. i am never satisfied,"" he once said. in 1969, he moved to nassau in the bahamas, with his wife sheila. wheels (1971), the moneychangers (1975) and overload (1979) followed. despite a lukewarm response from critics, and few literary accolades, hailey was at the height of his fame in the seventies and continued to attract the attention of hollywood producers. strong medicine, hailey's blockbuster focusing on the pharmaceutical industry, was turned into a film in 1986, starring sam neill, douglas fairbanks jr and a panoply of former soap stars. the 1997 novel detective proved to be hailey's final book, when at the age of 77 he decided to retire. hailey's health began to deteriorate in recent years, twice undergoing heart surgery. he suffered a stroke just two months ago. he died in his sleep on wednesday, after dinner with his wife and two of his six children at his home in new providence island. ""he had a wonderful life. his greatest ambition was to see his name on a book and he certainly achieved that,"" said his wife, sheila.

1881,"gm in crunch talks on fiat future

fiat will meet car giant general motors (gm) on tuesday in an attempt to reach agreement over the future of the italian firm's loss-making auto group.

fiat claims that gm is legally obliged to buy the 90% of the car unit it does not already own; gm says the contract, signed in 2000, is no longer valid. press reports have speculated that fiat may be willing to accept a cash payment in return for dropping its claim. both companies want to cut costs as the car industry adjusts to waning demand.

the meeting between fiat boss sergio marchionne and gm's rick wagoner is due to take place at 1330 gmt in zurich, according to the reuters news agency.

mr marchionne is confident of his firm's legal position, saying in an interview with the financial times that gm's argument ""has no legs"". the agreement in question dates back to gm's decision to buy 20% of fiat's auto division in 2000. at the time, it gave the italian firm the right, via a 'put option', to sell the remaining stake to gm. in recent weeks, fiat has reiterated its claims that this 'put' is still valid and legally binding. however, gm argues that a fiat share sale made last year, which cut gm's holding to 10%, together with asset sales made by fiat have terminated the agreement.

selling the fiat's car-making unit may not prove so simple, analysts say, especially as it is a company that is so closely linked to italy's industrial heritage. political and public pressure may well push the two firms to reach a compromise. ""we are not expecting fiat to exercise its put of the auto business against an unwilling gm at this point,"" brokerage merrill lynch said in a note to investors, adding that any legal battle would be protracted and damaging to the business. ""as far as we are aware, the agnelli family, which indirectly controls at least 30% of fiat, has not given a firm public indication that it wants to sell the auto business. ""fiat may be willing to cancel the 'put' in exchange for money.""

the value of the uk's housing stock reached the â£3.3 trillion mark in 2004 - triple the value 10 years earlier, a report indicates.

research from halifax, the country's biggest mortgage lender, suggests the value of private housing stock is continuing to rise steadily. all regions saw at least a doubling in their assets during the past decade. but northern ireland led the way with a 262% rise, while scotland saw the smallest increase of just 112%.

the core retail price index rose by just 28% in the same period, underlining how effective an investment in housing has been for most people during the past decade. more than a third of the uk's private housing assets - representing more than a trillion pounds in value - are concentrated in london and the south east, the halifax's figures indicate. tim crawford, group economist at halifax, said: ""the value of the private housing stock continues to grow and the family home remains, by a large margin, the most valuable asset of the majority of households in the uk."" halifax's own monthly figures on house sales - issued on thursday - suggest the average price of a british property now stands at â£163,748 after a 0.8% rise in january. housing experts are split on prospects for the market, with some saying price growth will slow but not fall, while others predict a sharp drop in values.

948,"gadgets galore on show at fair

the 2005 consumer electronics show in las vegas is a geek's paradise with more than 50,000 new gadgets and technologies launched during the four-day event.

top gadgets at the show are highlighted in the innovations showcase, which recognises some of the hottest developments in consumer electronics. the bbc news website took an early pre-show look at some of those technologies that will be making their debut in 2005. 

 

one of the key issues for keen gadget users is how to store all their digital images, audio and video files. the 2.5gb and 5gb circular pocket hard drive from seagate might help. the external usb drive won a ces best innovations design and engineering award and is small enough to slip into a pocket. ""it is the kind of storage that appeals to people who want their pcs to look cool,"" said seagate. ""it is all about style but it also has lots of functionality."" ""it is the first time you can say a hard drive is sexy,"" it said. in the centre of the device is a blue light that flashes while data is being written to ensure users do not unplug it when it is busy saving those precious pictures. 

 

universal electronics' nevosl is a universal controller that lets people use one device to get at their multimedia content, such as photos, no matter where it is in their house. it can also act as a remote for home theatre and stereo systems. working with home broadband networks and pcs, the gadget has built-in wireless and a colourful, simple interface. paul arling, uei chief, said consumers face real problems when trying to get at all the files they own that are typically spread across several different devices. he said the nevo gave people a simple, single way to regain some control over digital media in the home. the nevo won two awards at ces, one as a girl's best friend award and another for innovation, design and engineering. the gadget is expected to go on sale before the summer and will cost about $799 (â£425). 

 

hotseat is targeting keen gamers with money to spend with its solo chassis gaming chair. the specially-designed chair lets gamers play in surround-sound while stretching out in their own ""space"". it is compatible with all the major games consoles, dvd players and pcs. ""we found that kids love playing in surround sound,"" said jay leboff from hotseat. ""we are looking at offering different types of seats, depending on the market success of this one."" the chair also lets people experience surround sound while watching videos, with wireless control for six surround sound speakers. and a drinks holder. the chair, which looks like a car seat on a skeletal frame, should go on sale in april and is expected to cost $399 (â£211). 

 

satellite radio is big business in the us. in the uk, the digital radio technology is known as dab and works on slightly different technology. eton corporation's porsche designed p7131 digital radio set will be launched both as a dab radio in the uk as well as a satellite radio set in the us. dab sets have been slow to take-off in the uk, but this one concentrates on sleek looks as much as technology. ""it is for the risqu&#233; consumer,"" said an eton spokesperson. ""we are proud of it because it has the sound quality for the audiophile and the looks for the design-conscious consumer."" the porsche radio is set to go on sale at the end of january in the us and in the first quarter of 2005 in the uk. in the us is it expected to cost $250 (â£133). 

 

the average person has a library of 600 digital images estimates the consumer electronics association, the organisation behind ces. this is expected to grow to a massive 3,420 images - or 7.2gb - in five years' time. one gadget that might help swell that collection is sanyo's tiny handheld vpc-c4 camcorder which is another innovation in design and engineering award winner. it combines high quality video and stills in a very small device. it takes mpeg4 video quality at 30 frames a second and has a four megapixel still camera. images and video are stored on sd cards, which have come down in price in recent months. a 512mb card will store about 30 minutes of video and 420 stills. the device is so tiny it can be controlled with one thumb. because images and video are stored on sd memory, it is portable to other devices and means other data like audio can be stored on the card too. 

 

wearable technology has always promised much but failed to deliver because of lack of storage capability and poor design. mpio's tiny digital usb music players come in an array of fashionable colours, taking a leaf out of the apple ipod mini book of design and reflecting the desire for gadgets that look good. slung on a cord, the player would not look too geeky dangling discreetly from the neck. although the pendant design was launched three months ago, the device emphasises large storage as well as good looks for fashion-conscious gadget fiends. an even dinkier model, the fy500, comes out in may and will store about 256mb of music. the range of players recently won an international forum design award 2005.

the original stars of swedish pop quartet abba have reunited for the home premiere of hit musical mamma mia! which is based on the band's songs.

it is the first time in almost 20 years that the four, bjorn ulvaeus, benny andersson, agnetha faltskog and anni-frid lyngstad, have met publicly. faltskog has been a virtual recluse since the band split up in 1982. the musical, which has become a global phenomenon, will be performed in swedish for the first time. fans camped outside stockholm's cirkus theatre in the snow for a glimpse of the stars. the premiere marks abba's first public reunion since the legendary band's acrimonious break-up in the early 1980s. it was thought that faltskog would appear in london for the musical's fifth anniversary celebrations in april 2004 but she stayed away due to her fear of flying.

original abba member bjorn ulvaeus set about translating the musical into the band's mother tongue for the celebrated homecoming, alongside swedish artist niklas stromstedt. almost all of abba's original songs, which have sold more than 350 million records worldwide, were written and recorded in english. the musical, set on a small greek island, tells of the story of a young woman and her fiercely independent single mother. the show will include such classics as super trouper, sos and dancing queen. there are currently 14 productions being staged worldwide, including new york and london, with road shows in toronto, south korea and madrid. more than 20 million people around the world have seen the show.

1598,"downloads enter us singles chart

digital music downloads are being included in the main us singles chart for the first time.

billboard's hot 100 chart now incorporates data from sales of music downloads, previously only assigned to a separate download chart. green day's boulevard of broken dreams is currently number two in billboard's pop chart, and tops its digital chart. download sales are due to be incorporated into the uk singles chart later this year.

digital sales in the us are already used to compile billboard's hot digital sales chart. they will now be tallied with sales of physical singles and airplay information to make up its new hot 100 chart. its second new chart - the pop 100 - also combines airplay, digital and physical sales but confines its airplay information to us radio stations which play chart music. in addition to green day, other artists in the current us digital sales top 10 include kelly clarkson, the game and the killers.

sales of legally downloaded songs shot up more than tenfold in 2004, with 200 million track purchased online in the us and europe in 12 months, the international federation of the phonographic industry (ifpi) reported last month. in the uk sales of song downloads overtook those for physical singles for the first time at the end of last year. the last week of december 2004 saw download sales of 312,000 compared with 282,000 physical singles, according to the british phonographic industry. the uk's first official music download chart was launched last september, compiling the most popular tracks downloaded from legal uk sites - including itunes, od2, mycokemusic.com and napster. westlife's flying without wings - a 1999 track reissued for the occasion - was the first number one of the uk download chart.

a spokesman for the british phonographic industry (bpi) said the first combined uk download and sales chart was due to be compiled ""within the first half of this year"". ""work is going on across the music business right now to make sure the new chart works to plan,"" he said. the bpi spokesman described the uk music download chart, compiled by the official charts company, as having been ""a great success"" since its launch.

1571,"german music in a 'zombie' state

the german music business - the third largest in the world - is ""in the state of a zombie"" because it has failed to respond to the challenge posed by downloading and piracy, a leading industry figure has said.

tim renner, the head of universal music germany until last year, told bbc world service's the music biz programme that the country's music industry was now struggling to survive. renner warned that unless the industry accepted ""new realties"" - such as downloading - its decline could become irreversible. ""the problem the music industry has got is that they aren't willing to accept that the classic way of doing business is over and out,"" he stated. ""so the music industry in its current form over here is pretty much in the state of a zombie.""

the music market in germany peaked in 1997, with sales of 2.6bn euros (â£1.8bn). since 2000, sales have plummeted to just 1.6bn euros (â£1.1bn) in 2003. in the space of one year - between 2002 and 2003 - cd album sales fell by 13.8%. but a study by the society for consumer research found that at the same time, more than twice as many recordable cds had music recorded on them than cd albums were sold. mr renner pointed out that, because profit comes mainly from the longevity of a good-selling record, this was particularly damaging.

""you need time,"" he added. however, peter zombic, the managing director of the international federation of phonographic industry in germany, said he did not feel the situation was as ""dramatic"" as mr renner believed. ""it's quite true that we have severe problems in germany - but that's true in other parts of the world and in most developed markets too,"" he argued. ""we have a severe problem with piracy, especially internet piracy, and we also have a severe problem of private copying. ""i don't agree that the music industry lost control over the music market - in fact, especially in regard to germany talent, the market is quite successful."" he did, however, admit that copyright owners have ""partly lost control of their copyright"", due to piracy and copying.

but he refuted suggestions that the industry had been too slow to respond to digital downloading. ""we were the first to implement a download service - back in 1997,"" he argued. ""at that time it was not successful, because of the advent of piracy - it was the napster time, when p2p services became popular. ""it still is quite difficult for the music industry to compete with a price that is zero as far as the illegal product is concerned."" mr zombic also called for a change to the perception in germany that private copying of music is not a problem. german law does allow people to make copies of cds for their family and close friends, without fear of breaking copyright. mr zombic said that this legal framework was a ""huge problem"".

968,"pompeii gets digital make-over

the old-fashioned audio tour of historical places could soon be replaced with computer-generated images that bring the site to life.

a european union-funded project is looking at providing tourists with computer-augmented versions of archaeological attractions. it would allow visitors a glimpse of life as it was originally lived in places such as pompeii. it could pave the way for a new form of cultural tourism.

the technology would allow digital people and other computer-generated elements to be combined with the actual view seen by tourists as they walk around an historical site.

the lifeplus project is part of the eu's information society technologies initiative aimed at promoting user-friendly technology and enhancing european cultural heritage. engineers and researchers working in the europe-wide consortium have come up with a prototype augmented-reality system. it would require the visitor to wear a head-mounted display with a miniature camera and a backpack computer. the camera captures the view and feeds it to software on the computer where the visitor's viewpoint is combined with animated virtual elements. at pompeii for example, the visitor would not just see the frescos, taverns and villas that have been excavated, but also people going about their daily life. augmented reality has been used to create special effects in films such as troy and lord of the rings and in computer gaming.

""this technology can now be used for much more than just computer games,"" said professor nadia magnenat-thalman of the swiss research group miralab.

""we are, for the first time, able to run this combination of software processes to create walking, talking people with believable clothing, skin and hair in real-time,"" she said. unlike virtual reality, which delivers an entirely computer-generated scene to the viewer, the lifeplus project is about combining digital and real views. crucial to the technique is the software that interprets the visitor's view and provides an accurate match between the real and virtual elements. the software capable of doing this has been developed by a uk company, 2d3. andrew stoddart, chief scientist at 2d3, said that the eu project has been driven by a new desire to bring the past to life. ""the popularity of television documentaries and dramatisations using computer-generated imagery to recreate scenes from ancient history demonstrates the widespread appeal of bringing ancient cultures to life,"" he said.

hollywood blockbuster the aviator and low-budget british movie vera drake have shared the main honours at the 2005 bafta film awards. the aviator was declared best film, and its star cate blanchett won best supporting actress. but vera drake scored best director for mike leigh while imelda staunton took the hotly contested best actress award. jamie foxx won best actor for ray, while british actor clive owen took best supporting actor for closer. the two actors have repeated their success at the golden globes in january. but big british hope kate winslet walked away empty-handed on saturday despite two nominations for best actress. celebrating his win, the oscar-nominated owen told reporters: ""the whole award season is new to me because i haven't won anything before. all of that is a bit overwhelming."" blanchett, who won a bafta in 1999 for her leading role in elizabeth, said: ""winning a bafta means an enormous amount to me."" she thanked the woman she played, katharine hepburn, for paving the way for women to work in film. ""thank you very much, i'm sure you're pleased, although you're not able to see this,"" she said.

the aviator took four awards in all, also collecting best make-up and hair and production design, while vera drake also scooped best costume design. staunton, who is up for an oscar for her role in vera drake, arrived wearing a green silk and chiffon beaded evening dress. ""thank you very much. i'm so thrilled and so grateful and i'm delighted that the success of vera drake has boosted sales of hair nets and pinnies, which is very good,"" she said on accepting her award. her director leigh, who beat martin scorsese to the best director award, told the audience: ""we always say it was a surprise and sometimes i've said it and not meant it. on this occasion, given the other names, it's a real surprise and an extraordinary honour. ""it's an immense privilege to have been allowed the freedom to make as uncompromising a film as i think vera drake is and an epic with such a small budget."" best actor foxx could not make the ceremony, but actress helen mirren read out his acceptance speech.

949,"anti-tremor mouse stops pc shakes

a special adaptor that helps people with hand tremors control a computer mouse more easily has been developed.

the device uses similar ""steady cam"" technology found in camcorders to filter out shaking hand movements. people with hand tremors find it hard to use conventional mice for simple computer tasks because of the erratic movements of the cursor on the screen. about three million britons have some sort of hand tremor condition, said the uk national tremor foundation. ""using a computer mouse is well known for being extremely hard for people with tremors so we're delighted to hear that a technology has been developed to address this problem,"" said karen walsh, from the uk national tremor foundation. most commonly associated with tremors is parkinson's disease, but they can also be caused by other conditions like essential tremor (et). tremors more often affect older people, but can hit all ages. et, for example, is genetic and can afflict people throughout their lives.

the assistive mouse adapter (ama) is the brainchild of ibm researcher jim levine who developed the prototype after seeing his uncle, who has parkinson's disease, struggle with mouse control. ""i knew that there must be way to improve the situation for him and the millions of other tremor sufferers around the world, including the elderly.

""the number of elderly computer users will increase as the population ages, and at the same time, the need for computer access grows,"" he said. computer users plug the device into a pc, and it can be adjusted depending on how severe the tremor is. it is also able to recognise multiple clicking on a mouse button caused by shaky digits. ibm said it would partner up with a small uk-based electronics firm, montrose secam, to produce the devices which will cost about â£70. james cosgrave, one of the company's directors, said it would make a big difference to those with tremors. ""i'm a pilot and my tremor condition has not limited my ability to fly a plane,"" he said. ""but using a pc has proven almost impossible simply because everything revolves around using the mouse to accurately manipulate the tiny cursor on the screen."" he said a prototype of the gadget had transformed his life.

the device could help open up computing to millions more people who have found shaking to be a barrier. last year, the office for national statistics reported that for the first time, more than half of all households in britain had a home computer. with prices getting cheaper to get online too, computer ownership is increasing. but although 62% of british people have tried the internet, only 15% of britons aged 65 or over have been online. more than six million uk households now have a broadband net. by the middle of 2005, it is estimated that 50% of all uk net users will be on broadband. there are still millions using the net through dial-up connections too.

943,"cabs collect mountain of mobiles

gadgets are cheaper, smaller and more common than ever. but that just means we are more likely to lose them.

in london alone over the past six months more than 63,000 mobile phones have been left in the back of black cabs, according to a survey. that works out at about three phones per cab. over the same period almost 5,000 laptops and 5,800 pdas such as palms and pocket pcs were left in licensed cabs. even the great and good are not immune to losing their beloved gadgets. jemima khan reportedly left her ipod, phone and purse in a cab and asked for them to be returned to her friend who turned out to be hugh grant. as the popularity of portable gadgets has grown, and we trust more of our lives to them, we seem to be forgetting them in ever larger numbers. the numbers of lost laptops has leapt by 71% in the last three years.

this has left londoners, or those travelling by cab in the capital, as the world's best at losing laptops, according to the research by the licensed taxi drivers association and pointsec, a mobile-data backup firm. more than twice as many laptops were left in the back of black cabs in london as in any of the nine other cities (helsinki, oslo, munich, paris, stockholm, copenhagen, chicago and sydney) where the research into lost and found gadgets was carried out. by contrast danes were most adept at losing mobile phones being seven times more likely to leave it behind in a cab than travellers in germans, norwegians and swedes. top of the range phones can carry enormous amounts of data - enough to hold hundreds of pictures or thousands of contact details. given that few people back up the data on their pc it is a fair bet that even fewer do so with the phone they carry around. you could be losing a fair chunk of your life in the back of that cab not least because many people collect numbers on their phone that they do not have anywhere else.

equally, phones let you navigate through contacts by name so many people have completely forgotten their friends' numbers and could not reconstruct them if they had to. this growing habit of losing gadgets explains the rise of firms such as retrofone which lets people buy a cheap old-fashioned phone to replace the tiny, shiny expensive one they have just lost. briton's growing love of phones has also led to the creation of the mobile equipment national database that lets you register the unique id number of your phone so it can be returned to you in the event of it being lost or stolen. according to statistics 50% of all muggings and snatch theft offences involve mobiles. millions of gadgets are now logged in the database and organisations such as transport for london regularly consult it when trying to re-unite folk with their phones and other gadgets. for the drivers, finding a mobile in the back of their cab is one of the more pleasant things many have found. the survey of what else has been left behind included a harp, a dog, a hamster and a baby.

1306,"why cell will get the hard sell

the world is casting its gaze on the cell processor for the first time, but what is so important about it, and why is it so different?

the backers of the processor are big names in the computer industry. ibm is one of the largest and most respected chip-makers in the world, providing cutting edge technology to large businesses. sony will be using the chip inside its playstation 3 console, and its dominance of the games market means that it now has a lot of power to dictate the future of computer and gaming platforms. the technology inside the cell is being heralded as revolutionary, from a technical standpoint. traditional computers - whether they are household pcs or playstation 2s - use a single processor to carry out the calculations that run the computer. the cell technology, on the other hand, uses multiple cell processors linked together to run lots of calculations simultaneously.

this gives it processing power an order of magnitude above its competitors. whilst its rivals are working on similar technology, it is sony's which is the most advanced. the speed of computer memory has been slowly increasing over the last few years, but the memory technology that accompanies the cell is a huge leap in performance.

using a technology called xdr, created by american firm rambus, memory can run up to eight times faster than the current standard being promoted by intel. perhaps more important than any of the technology is the cell's role in the imminent ""war on living rooms"". the big trend predicted for this year is the convergence of computers with home entertainment devices such as dvd players and hi-fis. companies like microsoft and sony believe that there is a lot of money to be made by putting a computer underneath the tv of every household and then offering services such as music and video downloads, as well as giving an individual access to all the media they already own in one place.

microsoft has already made its first tactical move into this area with its windows media center software, which has been adopted by many pc makers. sony had a stab at something similar with the psx - a variation on the playstation - last year in japan, although this attempt was generally seen as a failure. both companies believe that increasing the capabilities of games consoles, to make them as powerful as pcs, will make the technology accessible enough to persuade buyers to give them pride of place on the video rack.

sony and ibm want to make sure that the dominance of the pc market enjoyed by microsoft and intel is not allowed to extend to this market. by creating a radically new architecture, and using that architecture in a games console that is sure to be a huge seller, they hope that the cell processor can become the dominant technology in the living room, shutting out their rivals. once they have established themselves under the tv, there is no doubt that they hope to use this as a base camp to extend their might into our traditional pcs and instigate a regime change on the desktop. cell is, in fact, specifically designed to be deployed throughout the house. the links between the multiple processors can also be extended to reach cell processors in entirely different systems.

sony hopes to put cells in televisions, kitchen appliances and anywhere that could use any sort of computer chip. each cell will be linked to the others, creating a vast home network of computing power. resources of the cells across the house can be pooled to provide more power, and the links can also be used to enable devices to talk to each other, so that you can programme your microwave from your tv, for example. this digital home of the future depends on the widespread adoption of the cell processor and there are, as with all things, a number of reasons it could fail. because the processor is so different, it requires programmers to learn a different way of writing software, and it may be that the changeover is simply too difficult for them to master. you can also guarantee that microsoft and intel are not going to sit around and let cell take over home computing without a fight. microsoft is going to be pushing its xbox 2 as hard as possible to make sure that its technology, not sony's, will be under your tree next christmas. intel will be furiously working on new designs that address the problems of its current chips to create a rival technology to cell, so that it doesn't lose its desktop pc dominance. if cell succeeds in becoming the living room technology of choice, however, it could provide the jump-start to the fully digital home of the future. the revolution might not be televised, but it could well be played with a videogame controller.

232,"'best person' for top legal job

the ""best person for the job"" should be appointed lord chancellor, and not necessarily a lawyer or mp, the courts minister has told mps.

under reforms, the post of lord chancellor is to be stripped of its judicial functions. ""the lord chancellor...no more needs to be a lawyer than the secretary of health needs to be a doctor,"" said courts minister christopher leslie. the constitutional reform bill was entering its second reading on monday. mr leslie said: ""the prime minister should be able to appoint the best person for the job whether they sit in the house of lords or the house of commons."" under the reforms, the law lords will also be replaced as the uk's highest legal authority by a supreme court and judges will be appointed by an independent panel rather than ministers.

in december the lords rejected a plea by current lord chancellor lord falconer that the holder of the job should not necessarily be a lawyer or a peer. the peers voted by 229 to 206 to say in law that lord chancellors must also be peers. the debate was carried over from the last parliamentary session, but with an impending general election time is crucial for the government to get the bill passed. mr leslie said it was irrelevant whether the post was called secretary of state for constitutional affairs or lord chancellor. he said: ""what matters most is...whether it is reformed so that the post holder no longer has those conflicting duties. ""it is no longer appropriate for a government minister to have such unfettered discretion in the appointment of judges.""

shadow attorney general dominic grieve criticised the government on its plans to change what he said was an ""exceptional institution,"" providing a ""champion of the independence of the judiciary"". the government had initially proposed to take this institution and ""smash it to pieces,"" mr grieve said. convention should be ""nurtured and celebrated,"" but the government distrusted and disliked it instead. he warned that unless ministers backed down over the lord chancellor remaining a member of the house of lords, the government would have ""great difficulty"" in getting the bill through parliament. former cabinet minister douglas hogg, whose father and grandfather served as lord chancellor, said the bill was ""largely unnecessary, bureaucratic and expensive"". but the tory mp for sleaford and north hykeham admitted the lord chancellor's role and office ""cannot be frozen in aspic"".

49,"brown in appeal for labour unity

gordon brown has made an appeal for unity after reports claimed mr blair went back on a pledge to stand down before the next general election.

the chancellor would not comment on the reports, but insisted he would not be ""diverted or distracted"" from tackling the challenges faced by the country. his only ""motivation"" was to ensure labour was re-elected, he insisted. mr blair earlier dismissed the claim he had reneged on a promise to stand aside for gordon brown as old news. according to a new book, brown's britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston, mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june 2004.

in an interview with bbc one's breakfast with frost, mr blair said: ""i've dealt with this six months ago. i said then you don't do deals over jobs like this - you don't. ""what both of us are actually concentrating on are the issues that concern the country.""

in a separate interview with bbc political editor andrew marr, mr brown said: ""it's very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a labour government. ""i think it is very important to stress that that is the motivation that i have. ""that is my purpose in politics, and that is what every day i seek to do. and i am not going to be diverted or distracted, nor is tony blair, by newspaper stories or books or rumours or gossip. ""the only reason why we are in government is to get on with the job in a unified way to deal with the challenges facing this country."" mr brown also said he had discussed the general election campaign with the prime minister on saturday and pledged to play his part as he had been asked to do.

but mr peston said the pair had ""mutual animosity and contempt"" for each other and that mr blair had decided in november 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters' trust because of the iraq war. he then changed his mind in june 2004, following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, according to the book. andrew marr said: ""this is enormously damaging. gordon brown knows it as well as tony blair. ""i think the relationship is genuinely, privately, very poor indeed. things are very difficult."" he added: ""lots of ministers believe tony blair will attempt to move gordon brown out of the treasury after the election. ""that depends on whether there's still a labour government and their majority.""

senior mps are expected to raise concerns about the latest reports of infighting at the regular meeting of labour backbenchers on monday.

health secretary john reid said those fuelling such reports were damaging labour's re-election chances and would not be easily forgiven. fresh speculation of a rift recently followed mr blair and mr brown's separate responses to the asian tsunami. these rumours were fuelled by mr blair's decision to hold his monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new ""marshall plan"" for africa. there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other's response to the disaster. but the prime minister said he had discussed these claims with the chancellor and dismissed them as a ""load of nonsense"". tory leader michael howard accused the prime minister and mr brown of""squabbling like schoolboys"". liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said the personal ambition of mr blair and mr brown was ""getting in the way of good government"".
","in a separate interview with bbc political editor andrew marr, mr brown said: ""it's very important that we all do what we can in a unified way to ensure the election of a labour government.liberal democrat parliamentary chairman matthew taylor said the personal ambition of mr blair and mr brown was ""getting in the way of good government"".according to a new book, brown's britain by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston, mr blair went back on a pledge to make way for mr brown after cabinet allies intervened in june 2004.but mr peston said the pair had ""mutual animosity and contempt"" for each other and that mr blair had decided in november 2003 he would quit because he felt he had lost voters' trust because of the iraq war.mr brown also said he had discussed the general election campaign with the prime minister on saturday and pledged to play his part as he had been asked to do.gordon brown has made an appeal for unity after reports claimed mr blair went back on a pledge to stand down before the next general election.mr blair earlier dismissed the claim he had reneged on a promise to stand aside for gordon brown as old news.fresh speculation of a rift recently followed mr blair and mr brown's separate responses to the asian tsunami.in an interview with bbc one's breakfast with frost, mr blair said: ""i've dealt with this six months ago.gordon brown knows it as well as tony blair.he added: ""lots of ministers believe tony blair will attempt to move gordon brown out of the treasury after the election.tory leader michael howard accused the prime minister and mr brown of""squabbling like schoolboys"".",politics,622,278

teenagers questioned for a survey have shown little interest in politics - and have little knowledge.

only a quarter of 14-16 year olds knew that labour was the government, the tories were the official opposition and the lib dems were the third party. almost all could identify tony blair, but only one in six knew who michael howard was, and just one in 10 recognised charles kennedy. the icm survey interviewed 110 pupils for education watchdog ofsted. nearly half those pupils polled said it was not important for them to know more about what the political parties stand for. and 4% of those questioned thought the conservatives were in power - while 2% of them believed the lib dems were. the survey also looked at issues of nationality. it found the union flag and fish and chips topped the list of symbols and foods associated with being british. many of the pupils also looked on themselves as english, scottish or welsh, rather than british; while the notion of being european hardly occurred to anyone.

ethiopia produced 14.27 million tonnes of crops in 2004, 24% higher than in 2003 and 21% more than the average of the past five years, a report says.

in 2003, crop production totalled 11.49 million tonnes, the joint report from the food and agriculture organisation and the world food programme said. good rains, increased use of fertilizers and improved seeds contributed to the rise in production. nevertheless, 2.2 million ethiopians will still need emergency assistance.

the report calculated emergency food requirements for 2005 to be 387,500 tonnes. on top of that, 89,000 tonnes of fortified blended food and vegetable oil for ""targeted supplementary food distributions for a survival programme for children under five and pregnant and lactating women"" will be needed.

in eastern and southern ethiopia, a prolonged drought has killed crops and drained wells. last year, a total of 965,000 tonnes of food assistance was needed to help seven million ethiopians. the food and agriculture organisation (fao) recommend that the food assistance is bought locally. ""local purchase of cereals for food assistance programmes is recommended as far as possible, so as to assist domestic markets and farmers,"" said henri josserand, chief of fao's global information and early warning system. agriculture is the main economic activity in ethiopia, representing 45% of gross domestic product. about 80% of ethiopians depend directly or indirectly on agriculture.

1230,"'podcasters' look to net money

nasa is doing it, 14-year-old boys in bedrooms are doing it, couples are doing it, gadget lovers - male and female - are definitely doing it.

it is podcasting - diy radio in the form of downloadable mp3 audio files. they can done by anyone who has a microphone, simple software, the net, and something to say. some liken them to talking ""audioblogs"" because many complement text-based weblogs - diary-like sites where people share their thoughts. they are essentially amateur radio shows on the net, on demand, and the ""movement"" is at very early stages. ""it's about real people saying real things and communicating,"" says adam curry, former mtv vj and the pied piper of podcasting. he was one of a community of people who created ipodder, a small computer program, known as an ""aggregator"".

it collects and automatically sends mp3 files to any digital music-playing device that can play wmp formats. those with digital music players can select which podcasts they like, and subscribe - for free - to that show's ""feed"". when a new podcast is available, it is automatically sent to the device when connected to a computer. ""it is totally going to kill the business model of radio,"" thinks curry. ""i just did a tour of madison avenue where all the big brands and advertising agencies of the world are,"" he says. ""and they are scared to death of the next generation - like my daughter who is 14 - who don't listen to radio. ""they are on msn, they've got their ipod, their mp3 player, they've got their xbox - they are not listening to radio. ""so how are they going to reach these audiences? ""it is the distribution that is changing and the barriers are being brought down so everyone can be part of it.""

it is a fledgling movement, but it is gaining momentum now that people have started thinking about how to make a business from it. ian fogg, jupiter research analyst, thinks there could be potential for business, but it could take an interesting turn if big companies, like apple and microsoft, get involved. ""it is a nascent area but quite exciting. it is yet another area that demonstrates the move to a digital lifestyle and digital home is not over,"" he says.

""podcasting is one of those interesting areas that bridges what you do at home and what you do out and about - a classic hybrid. it is another aspect of the ""time-shifting"" of content - the latest industry buzzword for being able to listen to what you want, when, and wherever you want. audiences are in the 10s, 100s, and 1,000s rather than millions. more than 4,300 podcasts are currently listed. curry's daily source code - which he committed to doing daily to inspire the community - has 10s of thousands of listeners.

but dave winer is doubtful. he designed the format called rss (really simple syndication), which gives web users an easy way to keep updated automatically on sites they like. podcasts rely on his technology because it is the way they are distributed. he is also writer of the longest-running weblog on the net, scripting news. he thinks its power lies in its democratising potential, not in its ""over-hyped"" business promise.

""we're the sources, the people doing stuff, and podcasting is a way to tell people who care what we're doing. ""no matter how you look at it, commercialising this medium isn't going to make very much money,"" he says. ""podcasting is going to be a medium of niches, with 'audiences' measured in the single digits, like e-mail or blogs. ""maybe in a few years, maybe six or seven digits. but it will have to sustain interest beyond the hype balloon."" curry and associate ron bloom's new venture, called podshow, is to help ordinary people produce, post, distribute and market their podcasts. because of the way podcasts work, based on rss, the latest podcasts which people can select mean that they are ready-made targets. ""when you look at podcasting - wow this is a pretty interesting audience. the audience is pre-selected. they have decided to subscribe to your program,"" explains curry. advertising, in his eyes, can be tailored to podcasts, to make it more imaginative and unobtrusive. ""how i believe this will work, is to create a network that, in aggregation, will have enough numbers to support a return on investment for the advertisers and for the podcasters. ""i have 50, 60, 70,000 listeners. i could make a couple of bucks off that, but not much. if you are talking a million podcasters, and then you can kind of divide that amongst ourselves, then that is kind of interesting."" essentially, he says, if you are doing a bass fishing podcast, someone who is selling bait and tackle will probably want to advertise on your show. he is clear the ads will not be the traditional ""in-your-face"" type familiar to commercial radio now. ""we are really going to see these microcosms and commerce will be all over the place.""

it is happening already. coffee-loving curry has sold $4,000 worth of coffee machines through a referral link to amazon from his site.

others use in-show promotions, like the dawn and drew show. one, eric rice, has won sponsorship from warner bros. he can now legally play the music of a band warner bros wants to push. some commentators on the net say it has a similar feel to the dotcom days. others say it is just another element of setting media free from big companies and letting people be creative. one thing is for sure; they are not about to disappear in a hurry. the creative forces behind radio are elated, says curry. for now, he tunes out the negative comments within the podcasting community. ""i should be knighted for this,"" he adds, with a wry chuckle, ""people are going to be so happy to sit at home, make their podcast, and make a little money.""

2066,"french wine gets 70m euro top-up

the french government is to hand its struggling wine industry 70m euros ($91m) in aid to help it battle falling sales and damaging overproduction.

the financial package is aimed at assisting vintners in financial trouble and improving how its wine is marketed. the french wine industry, the world's second largest, has been hit by declining consumption at home and the growing popularity of new world wines. wine makers, however, claimed the support did not go far enough. the package was announced by agriculture minister dominique bussereau after talks with vintners' representatives.

the bulk of the money - about 40m euros - will be offered in the form of preferential loans to heavily indebted producers to enable them to reschedule their payments. a further 15m euros will be made available to wine cooperatives, which make up the majority of french producers, in low interest loans. efforts to promote french wine abroad are to be boosted by an extra 3.5m euros in funding. france fell behind the 'new world' producers of australia, chile and the united states for the first time in 2003 in terms of exports.

domestic consumption, accounting for 70% of sales, has suffered from strict restrictions on advertising and tough drink-driving laws.

the aid package would ""create a positive climate around french viticulture,"" mr bussereau said. however, wine makers and farmers said the support was much less than they had been hoping for. ""i am afraid the resources are not up to the ambitions,"" jean-michel lemetayer, from the fnsea agricultural union, told the associated press news agency. in an effort to tackle overcapacity, the government will agree that vines can be destroyed in areas where growers give their unanimous consent, while 500 vintners will be helped to take early retirement. the government will also seek european union approval to distil about 250 million litres of excess wine into alcohol, with vintners receiving compensation. production is currently outstripping demand by about 30%. the support is designed to make french producers more competitive in the face of increasing global consolidation across the wine industry. wine makers in france's best-known regions, such as burgundy, have found it hard to invest in new technology and to create recognisable brands to appeal to overseas buyers.

1936,"japan turns to beer alternatives

japanese brewers are increasingly making money from beer-flavoured drinks rather than beer itself

beer and spirits are heavily taxed in japan, driving breweries to search for alternatives. japan's long economic downturn helped drive the trend, as drinkers looked for cheaper opportunities to drown their sorrows. now, according to asahi breweries, the market for so-called ""beer-like"" drinks is set to grow 84% this year.

asahi is predicting profits to rise 50% in 2005 as it launches a drink based on soybean peptides rather than malt. the chosen name, ""shinnama"" or ""new draft"", disguises its non-beer nature. but despite a record profit in 2004 of 30.6bn yen ($291m; â£154m), up 31.8% on the previous year, asahi is coming late to the market. key rival sapporo is already well-established with the beer-flavoured ""draft one"". suntory, meanwhile, is doing well with ""super blue"", which combines happoshu - an existing low-cost beer alternative made with malt and seawater - and shochu, a distilled alcohol derived from sweet potatoes or barley. happoshu has been a mainstay of brewery profits for years, taking over from beer thanks to its low tax and therefore low cost. kirin, the fourth big name, is launching its own ""third-type"" drink in april.

2215,"banker loses sexism claim

a former executive at the london offices of merrill lynch has lost her â£7.5m ($14.6m) sex discrimination case against the us investment bank.

an employment tribunal dismissed stephanie villalba's allegations of sexual discrimination and unequal pay. but the 42-year-old won her claim of unfair dismissal, resulting from her sacking in august 2003. her partial victory is likely to cap her compensation to about â£55,000, a tiny fraction of what she asked for. the extent of damages will be assessed in the new year. the action - the biggest claim heard by an employment tribunal in the uk - had been viewed as something of a test case.

the tribunal decided that ms villalba had been unfairly dismissed because, having been removed from a senior post, she was entitled to wait to see if a suitable alternative position could be found in the organisation. ms villalba, the former head of merrill's private client business in europe, has made no decision on whether to appeal.

a spokesman for her lawyers described the decision as ""very disappointing"", but pointed to some criticism of merrill's procedures within the lengthy judgement. the tribunal upheld ms villalba's claim of victimisation on certain specific issues, including bullying e-mails in connection with a contract, but said it found no evidence of ""laddish culture"" at the bank. ""we said from the start that this case was about performance not gender,"" merrill said in a statement. ""ms villalba was removed by the very same person who had promoted her into the position and who then replaced her with another woman. ""merrill lynch is dedicated to creating a true meritocracy where every employee has the opportunity to advance based on their skills and hard work.""

based in london's financial district, ms villalba worked for merrill's global private client business in europe, investing funds for some of merrill's most important customers. but in 2003 her employers told her she had no future after 17 years with the company, and she was made redundant. merrill lynch denied ms villalba's claims and said she was removed from her post because of the extensive losses the firm was suffering on the continent. the firm had told the tribunal that ms villalba's division had been losing about $1m a week. merrill said ms villalba lacked the leadership skills to turn around the unit.

1275,"warnings about junk mail deluge

the amount of spam circulating online could be about to undergo a massive increase, say experts.

anti-spam group spamhaus is warning about a novel virus which hides the origins of junk mail. the program makes spam look like it is being sent by legitimate mail servers making it hard to spot and filter out. spamhaus said that if the problem went unchecked real e-mail messages could get drowned by the sheer amount of junk being sent.

before now many spammers have recruited home pcs to act as anonymous e-mail relays in an attempt to hide the origins of their junk mail. the pcs are recruited using viruses and worms that compromise machines via known vulnerabilities or by tricking people into opening an attachment infected with the malicious program. once compromised the machines start to pump out junk mail on behalf of spammers. spamhaus helps to block junk messages from these machines by collecting and circulating blacklists of net addresses known to harbour infected machines. but the novel worm spotted recently by spamhaus routes junk via the mail servers of the net service firm that infected machines used to get online in the first place. in this way the junk mail gets a net address that looks legitimate. as blocking all mail from net firms just to catch the spam is impractical, spamhaus is worried that the technique will give junk mailers the ability to spam with little fear of being spotted and stopped. steve linford, director of spamhaus, predicted that if a lot of spammers exploit this technique it could trigger the failure of the net's e-mail sending infrastructure. david stanley, uk managing director of filtering firm ciphertrust, said the new technique was the next logical step for spammers. ""they are adding to their armoury,"" he said. the amount of spam in circulation was still growing, said mr stanley, but he did not think that the appearance of this trick would mean e-mail meltdown. but kevin hogan, senior manager at symantec security response, said such warnings were premature. ""if something like this mean the end of e-mail then e-mail would have stopped two-three years ago,"" said mr hogan. while the technique of routing mail via mail servers of net service firms might cause problems for those that use blacklists and block lists it did not mean that other techniques for stopping spam lost their efficacy too. mr hogan said 90% of the junk mail filtered by symantec subsidiary brightmail was spotted using techniques that did not rely on looking at net addresses. for instance, said mr hogan, filtering out e-mail messages that contain a web link can stop about 75% of spam.

she said in an official statement: ""as a result of my suspension and subsequent termination without cause by delta airlines i am moving forward with filing a discrimination complaint with the federal government eeoc [us equal employment opportunity commission]."" she added she had also hired a texas-based law firm to initiate legal action for ""wrongful termination, defamation of character and lost future wages."" ms simonetti told the bbc news website she had received no warning or further explanation when she was suspended on 25 september. queen of the sky has received a lot of support and advice from the global blogging community since news of her suspension was brought to light on the bbc news website and others.

her story has highlighted concerns amongst the growing blogging community about conflicts of interest, employment law and free speech on personal websites. the blog, which she started in january as a way of getting over her mother's death, contains a mix of fictional and non-fictional accounts. queen of the sky developed over the months as a character in her own right, according to ms simonetti. in the postings, she made up fictional names for cities and other companies she mentioned to protect anonymity. but some postings contained images of herself in uniform. of the 10 or so images only one showed ms simonetti's flight ""wings"". she removed them as soon as she was informed of her suspension. ""i never meant it as something to harm my company and don't understand how they think it did harm them,"" ms simonetti said. a legal expert in the us speculated that delta might be concerned that the fictional content on the blog may be linked back to the airline after the images were posted.

delta has been hit recently by pressures of rising fuel costs and fierce competition. it has said it needs to cut between 6,000 and 7,000 jobs and reduce costs by $5bn (â£2.7bn) a year. analysts had warned recently that the airline might have to seek chapter 11 bankruptcy prevention. last week, it struck a $1bn cost-cutting deal with its pilots which could save it from bankruptcy. the deal would see pilots accept a 32% pay cut in return for the right to buy 30 million delta shares, unions said. and on monday, it negotiated a deal to defer about $135m in debt which was due next year, until 2007. the airline also said it had agreed the terms of a $600m loan from american express.

195,"jowell rejects 'las vegas' jibe

the secretary of state for culture, media and sport, tessa jowell, has hit out at critics of the gambling bill.

she told the guardian newspaper there would be no ""las vegas-style"" super-casinos, as rumoured in the press. meanwhile labour backbencher stephen pound labelled casino-related regeneration schemes ""a pile of pants"". the mp for ealing north claimed the legislation would encourage a mafia-like culture of vice and corruption, in an interview on bbc radio 4. ""you look at some of the people who are involved...they aren't in there to regenerate blackpool. they are in it to fill their boots,"" mr pound told the today programme. ""i just really think that we have made a terrible mistake here. and over all of it hangs the shadow of the men in the chalk-stripe suits with names that rhyme with spaghetti,"" he said.

ms jowell complained of the ""scale of misrepresentation"" in the media over the bill in her interview with the newspaper, her first since the bill was launched. the culture secretary said a four year consultation period had produced a consensus on the need to ""protect children and the vulnerable"" in a swiftly changing sector. ms jowell insisted: ""we have a good track record for extracting planning gain in this country, for instance in social housing."" and continued: ""we can be proud to have one of the lowest rates of problem gambling in the world. i intend to keep it that way."" ms jowell will set out her position when the bill is debated in the commons on monday. in prime minister's questions last week tony blair assured parliament that 90% of the bill was about tightening up the regulation of the gambling industry.

384,"tv debate urged for party chiefs

broadcasters should fix a date for a pre-election televised debate between the three main political leaders, according to the hansard society.

it would then be up to tony blair, michael howard and charles kennedy to decide whether to take part, the non-partisan charity said. chairman lord holme argued that prime ministers should not have the right of veto on a matter ""of public interest"". ""the broadcasters should make the decision to go ahead,"" he said.

lord holme's proposal for a televised debate comes just four months after millions of viewers were able to watch us president george w bush slug it out verbally with his democratic challenger john kerry. he said it was a ""democratically dubious proposition"" that it was up to the incumbent prime minister to decide whether a similar event takes place here.

if mr blair did not want to take part, the broadcasters could go ahead with an empty chair or cancel the event and explain their reasons why, lord holme said. ""what makes the present situation even less acceptable is that although mr howard and mr kennedy have said they would welcome a debate, no-one has heard directly from the prime minister,"" he said. ""it has been left to nudges and winks, hints and briefings from his aides and campaign managers to imply that mr blair doesn't want one, but we haven't heard from the prime minister himself.""

lord holme, who has campaigned for televised debates at previous elections, said broadcasters were ""more than willing to cooperate with the arrangements"". opinion polls suggested that the idea had the backing of the public who like comparing the personalities and policies of the contenders in their own homes, he said.

lord holme argued that as part of their public service obligations, broadcasters ""should make the decision to go ahead"" as soon as the election is called. an independent third-party body such as the hansard society or electoral commission could work out the ground rules so they were fair to participants and informative to the public, he said. ""it would be up to each party leader to accept or refuse,"" said lord holme.

""if the prime minister's reported position is true and he does want to take part, he would then be obliged to say why publicly. ""the broadcasters would then have the option of cancelling the event for obvious and well-understood reasons, or going ahead with an empty chair. ""either way would be preferable to the present hidden veto."" the hansard society has long campaigned for televised debates and has published reports on the issue in 1997 and 2001. tony blair has already ruled out taking part in a televised debate during the forthcoming election campaign. last month he said: ""we answer this every election campaign and, for the reasons i have given before, the answer is no,"" he said at his monthly news conference.""

132,"nat insurance to rise, say tories

national insurance will be raised if labour wins the next election, tory leader michael howard has claimed.

tony blair has said he does not want higher tax rates for top earners but on wednesday said other tax promises would be left to labour's manifesto. prime minister's questions also saw mr blair predict that new plans would probably cut net immigration. he attacked tory plans to process asylum claims abroad - but mr howard said labour had proposed the idea too.

the commons questions session again saw the leaders of the two biggest parties shape up for the forthcoming election campaign. the tories have promised â£4bn in tax cuts but have yet to say where they will fall. mr howard pointed to the institute for fiscal studies' predictions that labour will need to increase taxes to cover an â£11bn gap in its spending plans. he accused ministers of wasting money on unsuccessful attempts to curb bad behaviour and truancy in schools and on slow asylum processing. it was no good mr blair claiming tax pledges were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to mps on tuesday about the top rate of income tax, argued mr howard. pointing to national insurance, he added: ""everyone knows tax will go up under labour: isn't it now clear which tax it would be?""

mr blair instead hailed labour's achievement in using a strong economy to invest in public services. ""when we have money not only going into extra teachers and nurses but equipment in schools and hospitals, that money is not wasted,"" he said. on the tax questions, he added: ""we will make commitments on tax at the time of the manifesto."" home secretary charles clarke this week published plans for a new points system for economic migrants, with only high-skilled workers allowed into the uk from outside the european union.

mr blair said abuses would be weeded out and chain migration, where families automatically get the right to settle with immigrant workers, would end. that would probably create a fall in the migrant numbers, he said. the prime minister ridiculed the tory plans for asylum quotas and for processing all asylum claims overseas. he challenged the tories on which country would house their processing centres - what he called a ""fantasy island"". mr howard read from a letter about the government's own plans at the european council of ministers for processing asylum seekers outside the eu. but mr blair said: ""all the other countries could not agree on the way forward, nor could the un.""

the second pop idol-style search for literary talent has begun with the help of the brother of simon cowell.

writer tony cowell is among the judges who will hear aspiring writers read their work aloud. the winner gets a deal with literary agency curtis brown.

this year, the competition is specifically looking for a crime writer. writers must submit up to 10,000 words from the opening chapters of their novels and a synopsis. professional readers will choose a shortlist of five following the competition closing date on 14 january.

the final five will then have to read their work in front of judging panel. a public vote will also take place, which will account for 25% of the final decision. the winner will be announced at the london book fair on 14 march next year and could be screened on tv. ""it's very, very hard to find an agent and extremely difficult, without an agent, to get a publisher to look at your work,"" said cowell. ""people do fall by the wayside and the more avenues we can provide for aspiring authors, the better,"" he added. paul cavanagh, a former university professor and health care consultant from ontario in canada, was one of 1,466 aspiring novelists to enter the first contest. he lifted the inaugural lit idol prize after reading aloud an excerpt of his work northwest passage. three film studios are said to be interested in buying film rights for the book, even though it is not finished yet.

960,"britons fed up with net service

a survey conducted by pc pro magazine has revealed that many britons are unhappy with their internet service.

they are fed up with slow speeds, high prices and the level of customer service they receive. 17% of readers have switched suppliers and a further 16% are considering changing in the near future. it is particularly bad news for bt, the uk's biggest internet supplier, with almost three times as many people trying to leave as joining.

a third of the 2,000 broadband users interviewed were fed up with their current providers but this could be just the tip of the iceberg thinks tim danton, editor of pc pro magazine. ""we expect these figures to leap in 2005. every month the prices drop, and more and more people are trying to switch,"" he said. the survey found that bt and tiscali have been actively dissuading customers from leaving by offering them a lower price when they phone up to cancel their subscription. some readers were offered a price drop just 25p more expensive than that offered by an alternative operator, making it hardly worth while swapping.

other found themselves tied into 12-month contracts. broadband has become hugely competitive and providers are desperate to hold on to customers. 12% of those surveyed found themselves unable to swap at all. ""we discovered a huge variety of problems, but one of the biggest issues is the current supplier withholding the information that people need to give to their new supplier,"" said tim danton, editor of pc pro. ""this breaks the code of practice, but because that code is voluntary there's nothing we or ofcom can do to help,"" he said. there is a vast choice of internet service providers in the uk now and an often bewildering array of broadband packages. with prices set to drop even further in coming months mr danton advises everyone to shop around carefully. ""if you just stick with your current connection then there's every chance you're being ripped off,"" he warned.

3,"observers to monitor uk election

ministers will invite international observers to check the forthcoming uk general election is fairly run.

the move comes amid claims the poll could be marred by electoral fraud. a report by two mps committees called on thursday for urgent changes to the electoral registration system to combat vote rigging and boost turnout. but in a written response to labour mp gordon prentice, the government said it would normally invite observers to any uk election.

junior constitutional affairs minister christopher leslie said: ""i fully expect us to repeat our previous practice of doing so once the date for the next general election is announced."" the government has looked at ways of boosting voter turnout, which fell to 59% in the last general election in 2001.

but trial all-postal ballots in four english regions last summer were hit by delays and some fraud allegations. liberal democrat peer lord greaves called last week for international observers at the general election - saying otherwise there could be months of court challenges ""on a scale not seen since the 19th century"". thursday's report was drawn up by two committees scrutinising the work of the office of the deputy prime minister (odpm) and the department for constitutional affairs (dca). it said that, with the growth of postal voting, there was a strong case to tighten up fraud protection by requiring voters to register individually, rather than by household. it also said about three million people eligible to vote are not registered to do so.

figures for the 2001 general election suggest 29% of people aged between 18 and 24, and 19% of black voters were not on the electoral roll. young people in shared accommodation are thought to miss out because no one acts as head of the household to fill in the form. odpm committee chairman andrew bennett said individual voter registration, as opposed to registration by household, should be quickly introduced as it could ""dramatically reduce the chances of fraud"". but his counterpart on the dca committee, alan beith, said it should be delayed ""until measures likely to increase registration have been put in place and proved effective."" shadow constitutional affairs secretary oliver heald accused the government of ""dragging its feet"" over ""this badly needed measure"". ""it is vital that we move ahead with the northern ireland system of individual electoral registration to safeguard the integrity of the britain's electoral system,"" he said.

the report said individual registration should be treated carefully as 12% of voters disappeared from the electoral roll in northern ireland when it was introduced in 2002. the report said the government should consider fines for unregistered voters, but accepted many experts said it would be an expensive system that would be hard to enforce. it said incentives to register, such as â£20 council tax rebate, were likely to be seen as ""gimmicks"" and risked undermining the integrity of the system, mps said. instead they called for ""imaginative campaigns"" to boost interest.

the owners of embattled russian oil giant yukos are to ask the buyer of its former production unit to pay back a $900m (â£479m) loan.

state-owned rosneft bought the yugansk unit for $9.3bn in a sale forced by russia to part settle a $27.5bn tax claim against yukos. yukos' owner menatep group says it will ask rosneft to repay a loan that yugansk had secured on its assets. rosneft already faces a similar $540m repayment demand from foreign banks. legal experts said rosneft's purchase of yugansk would include such obligations. ""the pledged assets are with rosneft, so it will have to pay real money to the creditors to avoid seizure of yugansk assets,"" said moscow-based us lawyer jamie firestone, who is not connected to the case. menatep group's managing director tim osborne told the reuters news agency: ""if they default, we will fight them where the rule of law exists under the international arbitration clauses of the credit.""

rosneft officials were unavailable for comment. but the company has said it intends to take action against menatep to recover some of the tax claims and debts owed by yugansk. yukos had filed for bankruptcy protection in a us court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. the sale went ahead in december and yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft. yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky and has vowed to sue any participant in the sale.

us musical sweet charity has cancelled its run on broadway after poor ticket sales for its early shows.

star christina applegate had to pull out of pre-broadway performances earlier this month with a broken foot. producer barry weissler said he was ""deeply proud"" of the show, but said the decision to close it was ""painful but fiscally responsible"". applegate, who starred in tv comedy married with children, had been hoping to make her broadway debut in the show. the 33-year-old injured herself while performing in chicago, and had been hoping to recover in time for its official new york opening on 21 april. she had received mixed reviews for performances in minneapolis and chicago. previews of the $7.5m (â£4m) show were due to begin on 4 april. sweet charity tells the story of charity hope valentine, a dancer who always falls in love with the wrong man. it was first performed on broadway in 1966 with gwen verdon in the title role, while shirley maclaine starred in the 1969 film version.

1648,"john peel replacement show begins

the permanent replacement for late dj john peel's bbc radio 1 show goes on air on tuesday, with three hosts chosen to fill the legendary presenter's slot.

rock dj huw stephens will go on air in the 2300 slot every tuesday, with black music champion ras kwame on wednesdays and dance dj rob da bank on thursdays. rob da bank filled in after peel had a heart attack aged 65 in october. all three will play ""diverse, unpredictable and non-commercial"" songs under the banner of the onemusic show.

radio 1 said the station was not trying to replace peel, but would rise to the ""challenge"" of ""keeping his legacy alive"" with unpredictable music. the three djs were chosen for their ""in-depth musical knowledge across a variety of musical genres"", the station said.

rob da bank is one of the hosts of the blue room, an early morning weekend show which plays electronic and dance music. huw stephens has been one half of the thursday night show bethan and huw in wales, which explores new music, especially up-and-coming acts in wales. and ras kwame is host of 100% homegrown on radio 1's digital station 1xtra, dedicated to showcasing the best hip-hop and garage. another change to the station line-up will see sara cox return after maternity leave. she will host the lunchtime show on saturdays from this week.

good luck to all three of them, not one dj could fill peels boots so it's probably a good idea to get them all contributing. this time next year i hope we are saying how well these djs have done, but i fear this time next year we will really realise how much john peel will be forever missed.

very good idea to continue the legacy without attempting to replace john peel. also, there will surely be a wider spectrum for international music as three top radio djs unite under the one world name. congratulations!

the whole glory of john peel was the fact he was not commited to one genre. he played what he liked across the range of music.... this is not going to be the same, and all they seem to be doing is what they already have. bring back steve lamacq.

the obvious heir to john peel is the marvellous, wonderful and talented claire kember from totallyradio.com. this lady is young and fresh and is one of the most knowledgeable and likeable people in british broadcasting today. everyone who listens to her show understands and compares her to the ledgendary john peel. bbc radio should seek out the real talent from internet radio stations, people who are making a real impact on the world of music and the world in general.

1668,"stars shine on bafta red carpet

hollywood stars brought a touch of glamour to london on saturday for the biggest night in the british film calendar.

cate blanchett, leonardo dicaprio and richard gere were just some of the actors who attended the 2005 bafta film awards. they emerged from limos at leicester square to an uncertain british climate that threatened rain one moment and promised late winter sunshine the next. but the gods were certainly shining on the thousands of film fans who lined the red carpet to meet their idols. screaming built up into a crescendo as more and more big name stars appeared. the biggest cheer of the night was reserved for the aviator star leonardo dicaprio, who paused in the chilly february air to sign autographs for the throngs. he said the ear-piercing welcome was ""unlike anything i've ever encountered. it's very intense and very loud.""

best actress winner imelda staunton, who wore a green chiffon dress that sparkled with sequins and beads, told the bbc news website that vera drake was the highlight of her career. her role as a backstreet abortionist in the gritty low-budget film has already led to a clutch of awards and an oscar nomination. she said: ""never in a million years did i think this was going to happen. ""being here and just being nominated is great, but i hope it means more people will go and see the film as well."" rooting for staunton in the best actress category was cate blanchett, herself nominated for her supporting role as hollywood icon katherine hepburn in the aviator.

shivering in a floor-length shimmering armani dress, the australian-born actress stopped to sign autographs and joked: ""it's tight but i love it."" glamour was also brought to the evening by actress sienna miller, supermodel claudia schiffer - who was supporting her director husband matthew vaughn - troy actress diane kruger and star of the tv programme the oc, micha barton. wearing a caramel-coloured floaty frock by the designer alexander mcqueen, miller told reporters the red carpet experience was ""intense, nerve-wracking and cold"". the younger stars of british film were also represented in the shape of emma watson, who plays hermione in the harry potter films. the 14-year-old said she was hoping to meet dicaprio and keanu reeves but joked that ""they are probably a little too old for me"".

actor christian slater, who is currently starring in one flew over the cuckoo's nest in london's west end, was greeted by cries of ""christian, christian"" by the ever vocal crowd. keanu reeves, who presented the best actress award, said being on the red carpet was an ""exciting"" part of his job. ""it is always surreal and when it is nice, it is nice,"" he said. martin scorsese, whose movie the aviator went on to win best film, said being honoured in the uk meant a lot to him. he said: ""i am a great admirer of british cinema since the 1930s and 40s, up until now.

""they give me a new energy when i see the best coming out of england and every two or three years is a whole new cycle of tough and young film-makers, and even the older ones are making good films. ""to recognise me in this way is a great honour."" british actor clive owen, who has won a golden globe and a bafta for his supporting role in closer, said it ""meant a lot"" to be at the ceremony. he said: ""just to be here really, at the baftas. the bottom line is it is a celebration of british films.""

1316,"format wars could 'confuse users'

technology firms sony, philips, matsushita and samsung are developing a common way to stop people pirating digital music and video.

the firms want to make a system that ensures files play on the hardware they make but also thwarts illegal copying. the move could mean more confusion for consumers already faced by many different, and conflicting, content control systems, experts warned. they say there are no guarantees the system will even prevent piracy.

currently many online stores wrap up downloadable files in an own-brand control system that means they can only be played on a small number of media players. systems that limit what people can do with the files they download are known as digital rights management systems. by setting up the alliance to work on a common control system, the firms said they hope to end this current fragmentation of file formats. in a joint statement the firms said they wanted to let consumers enjoy ""appropriately licensed video and music on any device, independent of how they originally obtained that content"". the firms hope that it will also make it harder for consumers to make illegal copies of the music, movies and other digital content they have bought. called the marlin joint development association, the alliance will define basic specifications that every device made by the electronics firms will conform to. marlin will be built on technology from rights management firm intertrust as well as an earlier drm system developed by a group known as the coral consortium.

the move is widely seen as a way for the four firms to decide their own destiny on content control systems instead of having to sign up for those being pushed by apple and microsoft. confusingly for consumers, the technology that comes out of the alliance will sit alongside the content control systems of rival firms such as microsoft and apple. ""in many ways the different drm systems are akin to the different physical formats, such as betamax and vhs, that consumers have seen in the past,"" said ian fogg, personal technology and broadband analyst at jupiter research. ""the difference is that it is very fragmented,"" he said. ""it's not a two-horse race, it's a five, six, seven or even eight-horse race"" mr fogg said consumers had to be very careful when buying digital content to ensure that it would play on the devices they own. he said currently there were even incompatibilities within drm families. although initiatives such as microsoft's ""plays for sure"" program could help remove some of the uncertainty, he said, life was likely to be confusing for consumers for some time to come.

shelley taylor, analyst and author of a report about online music services, said the locks and limits on digital files were done to maximise the cash that firms can make from consumers. apple's itunes service was a perfect example of this, she said. ""although itunes has been hugely successful, apple could not justify its existence if it did not help sell all those ipods,"" she said.

she said rampant competition between online music services, of which there are now 230 according to recent figures, could drive more openness and freer file formats. ""it always works out that consumer needs win out in the long run,"" she said, ""and the services that win in the long run are the ones that listen to consumers earliest."" ms taylor said the limits legal download services place on files could help explain the continuing popularity of file-sharing systems that let people get hold of pirated pop. ""people want portability,"" she said, ""and with peer-to-peer they have 100% portability."" cory doctorow, european co-ordinator for the electronic frontier foundation which campaigns for consumers on many cyber-rights issues, expressed doubts that the marlin system would achieve its aims. ""not one of these systems has ever prevented piracy or illegal copying,"" he said. he said many firms readily admit that their drm systems are little protection against skilled attackers such as the organised crime gangs that are responsible for most piracy. instead, said mr doctorow, drm systems were intended to control the group that electronics firms have most hold over - consumers. ""the studios and labels perceive an opportunity to sell you your media again and again - the ipod version, the auto version, the american and uk version, the ringtone version, and so on.""

liverpool forward milan baros is uncertain whether he remains part of boss rafa benitez's plans after being dropped for the carling cup final.

baros, who is liverpool's leading scorer this season, denied reports of a row with benitez but claims he is mystified at being left on the bench. he told czech newspaper daily sport: ""i don't know why i didn't play on sunday. i didn't argue with anybody. ""i was disappointed but i am not thinking of leaving right now."" the czech international came on as a substitute after 74 minutes but could not prevent his side losing 3-2 to chelsea after extra-time.

baros denied suggestions he wanted to leave the millennium stadium before the match upon learning of his omission from the starting line-up. but his admission that he ""guessed something like this was going to happen on saturday"", will do little to quell claims of a falling-out with benitez. and although baros insisted thoughts of quitting anfield are ""not in my mind right now"", he admitted ""everything is possible"".

1909,"gold falls on imf sale concerns

the price of gold has fallen after the international monetary fund (imf) said it will look at ways of using its gold reserves to provide debt relief.

by revaluing its holdings, the imf may be able to sell billions of dollars of gold and use the cash to cancel debts owed by the world's poorest nations. the plan was put forward by g7 finance ministers over the weekend. the price of gold fell to $413.50 an ounce in asia, before rebounding slightly in early european trading.

imf boss rodrigo rato was asked by g7 ministers to carry out a study into the feasibility of revaluing and selling gold reserves.

he is expected to present his conclusions at an imf meeting in washington during april. ""whatever happens the market is going to be disconcerted and on the back foot until the april imf meetings,"" said john reade, an analyst at ubs. the imf values its gold reserves at between $40 and $50 an ounce, a price that was fixed in the 1970s and is about a tenth of the metal's current market value. the imf has 3,217 tonnes of gold, or about 113.5m ounces. bringing the book price of the gold in line with market value would boost the imf's balance sheet, giving it more money to distribute.

this idea has been put forward before, but there now seems to be a more committed political drive to address the issue of global poverty. ""this is the first time there has been a mention of the use of gold in a g7 communiqu&#233; for achieving debt relief,"" said uk chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown. at their meeting in london, g7 finance ministers backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts owed by some of the world's poorest countries. mr brown said the meeting would be remembered as ""the 100% debt relief summit"". while debt relief seems to have jumped to the top of the global agenda, not everyone is convinced that selling imf gold is the best way forward. the us, which can veto any plan to sell imf gold should it so choose, said it is looking at other ways of solving the problem. ""the us is not convinced that's the necessary way to do it,"" said treasury under secretary john taylor. canada, a key gold producer, also expressed reservations.

59,"blair backs 'pre-election budget'

tony blair has backed chancellor gordon brown's pre-budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the uk economy.

in a speech in edinburgh, the prime minister said thursday's report reinforced stability and opportunity. and that would be central to labour's next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced. mr brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.

he told bbc radio 4's today programme: ""no politician should make the mistake that john major and his colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are, they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing.

""that is not what politicians should do, it would not be responsible to do."" mr brown insisted his spending plans were ""affordable"" and he could afford to be optimistic because britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. mr blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the ""cornerstone"" of labour's programme.

in a speech at edinburgh's napier university, he said labour would publish over the next few months ""a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term"".

""in every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. all of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all,"" mr blair said. in his pre-budget report, mr brown surprised some city experts by forecasting uk growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year. many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated. carl emmerson, from the institute for fiscal studies, told bbc news: ""he thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will, in fact, be ok. we're not so sure."" david page, of investec securities, said: ""his forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of â£8bn is way too optimistic. ""it's going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets.""

conservative shadow chancellor oliver letwin said: ""i can't find a single economic forecaster from the imf to the institute of fiscal studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances. ""in order to deal with that he will have to raise taxes after the next general election."" mr letwin accused the chancellor of using ""fancy statistics"" to hide public service failures. vincent cable, for the liberal democrats, called on mr brown to open up the government's books to the national audit office, to see if he had met his ""golden rule"". ""it is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending,"" mr cable told mps.

2119,"house prices drop as sales slow

house prices fell further in november and property sale times lengthened as rate rises took their toll, the royal institute of chartered surveyors found.

a total of 48% of chartered surveyor estate agents reported lower prices in the three months to november - the highest level in 12 years. meanwhile the number of sales dropped 32% to an average of 22 per surveyor. the amount of unsold properties on their books rose for the sixth month in a row to an average of 67 properties. ""the slowdown occurring in the market has given buyers more power to negotiate, but this time of year is traditionally a quiet one,"" rics housing spokesman ian perry said. ""the decision by the bank of england not to increase interest rates further and the healthy economy is allowing confidence to consolidate.""

the figures support recent data from the government and other bodies which all point to a slowdown in the housing market. on monday, the council of mortgage lenders, british bankers association and building societies association all said mortgage lending was slowing. the figures were published as another survey by property website rightmove said the average asking price of a home fell by more than â£600 from â£190,329 in november to â£189,733 in december. around the uk, the midlands and south saw the biggest price falls, while london prices fell but at less than the national rate. in scotland, where prices have remained on an upward path, increases were more ""moderate"", rics added. but the news failed to dent confidence that sales will recover in future, with surveyors at their most optimistic in a year - as new purchase inquiries stabilised despite holding at lower levels. ""sales usually pick up in the new year and i am confident this year will be no exception,"" mr perry added. looking ahead, the group is anticipating a quiet start to 2005 with the market picking up in the second half - prompting a 3% rise in prices over the coming 12 months.

210,"blair defends terror law changes

the prime minister has defended measures to allow house arrest without trial, saying ""several hundred"" people in the uk are plotting terror attacks.

the government is facing opposition from tory and lib dem mps and its own backbenchers as it prepares for the final commons debate on the changes. but tony blair said there could be no concession on the ""basic principle"". mr blair told the bbc the ""control orders"" would only be used in the most limited circumstances. critics in the opposition and civil rights activists are worried that the home secretary will have the power to issue the detention orders. but the government has so far resisted pressure for judges to be responsible for making the orders, instead saying judges will be able to quash them.

an explanation is being sent by home secretary charles clarke to all mps and peers ahead of the final debate in the house of commons. on sunday, conservative shadow home secretary david davis claimed judges would get the powers to issue detention orders. and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said some concessions had already been offered by the government during last-minute negotiations. some 32 labour mps voted against the legislation last week. barbara follett, whose first husband was killed while under house arrest in south africa during the apartheid era, confirmed she would vote against the government.

but the government is continuing to insist that ""control orders"" must be issued by the home secretary. mr blair told bbc radio 4's woman's hour: ""we are being advised by the police and the security services... ""what they say is you have got to give us powers in between mere surveillance of these people - there are several hundred of them in this country who we believe are engaged in plotting or trying to commit terrorist acts - you have got to give us power in between just surveying them and being able, being sure enough of the proof, to prosecute them beyond reasonable doubt. ""and these will be restrictions on their liberty that we will use only in the most limited circumstances.""

a yougov poll in the daily telegraph suggested 75% of respondents thought action was sometimes necessary against people who had not committed an offence but who had been found by intelligence services to be planning a terrorist attack. but tory leader michael howard told bbc news that the government was again making a mistake in ""rushing"" anti-terrorism legislation. ""i very much hope it would be possible to reach a compromise on this."" he said after meeting tony blair he had been left with the impression that ""he really wasn't interested in any of the various proposals we have put forward"". mr clarke wants house arrest and other powers to replace indefinite jail for terror suspects - something the law lords have ruled against on the basis that it breaches human rights. bbc political correspondent vicky young said some form of concession on the measures was likely to be needed to get the legislation through the house of lords, where labour does not have a majority and would require support from other parties. shami chakrabarti, director of civil liberties pressure group liberty, said who was able to issue the control orders was not the main issue. she said the legislation was ""a travesty and a perversion of justice"" and would remain ""unpalatable"" even if a judge was involved early in the process.

""he was expecting a cross from matthew taylor and it ended up like a shot, so i don't blame him for what happened."" benitez admitted it was a costly loss of two points by liverpool, who followed up their derby defeat against everton with a disappointing draw. he said: ""we had many opportunities but didn't score and, in the end, a 1-0 lead was not enough.

2024,"ore costs hit global steel firms

shares in steel firms have dropped worldwide amid concerns that higher iron ore costs will hit profit growth.

shares in germany's thyssenkrupp, the uk's corus and france's arcleor fell while japan's nippon steel slid after it agreed to pay 72% more for iron ore. china's baoshan iron and steel co. said it was delaying a share sale because of weak market conditions, adding it would raise steel prices to offset ore costs. the threat of higher raw material costs also hit industries such as carmakers. france's peugeot warned that its profits may decline this year as a result of the higher steel, plastic and commodity prices.

steelmakers have been enjoying record profits as demand for steel has risen, driven by the booming economies of countries such as china and india. steel prices rose by 8% globally in january alone and by 24% in china.

the boom times are far from over, but analysts say that earnings growth may slow. the share price fall was initially triggered by news that two of the world's biggest iron ore suppliers had negotiated contracts at much-higher prices. miners rio tinto and cia. vale do rio dolce (cvrd) this week managed to boost by 72% the price of their iron ore, a key component of steel. analysts had expected japan's nippon to agree to a price rise of between 40% and 50%. steel analyst peter fish, director of sheffield-based consulting group meps, said the extent of cvrd's price rise was ""uncharted territory"", adding that the steel industry ""hasn't seen an increase of this magnitude probably in 50 years"". analysts now expect other iron ore producers, such as australia's bhp billiton, to seek annual price rises of up to 70%.

the news triggered the share price weakness. ""it sparked worries that steel makers might not be able to increase product prices further [ to cover rising ore costs]"" explained kazuhiro takahashi of daiwa securities smbc. in europe, arcelor shed 2.1% to 17.58 euros in paris, with thyssenkrupp dropping 1.7% to 16.87 euros. in london, corus fell 2.2% to 55.57 pence. japan's biggest steel company nippon steel lost 2.5% to 270 yen, with closest rival jfe holdings down 3.4%. china's baoshan, the country's largest steel producer, said that the uncertainty surrounding the industry has prompted it to pull its planned share sale. the firm had been expected to offer 22.5bn yuan ($2.7bn) worth of shares to investors. no date has been given for when the 5 billion shares will come to the market. baoshan stock climbed on news of the delay and its decision to increase the price of its steel by 10%.

1750,"japan economy slides to recession

the japanese economy has officially gone back into recession for the fourth time in a decade.

gross domestic product fell by 0.1% in the last three months of 2004. the fall reflects weak exports and a slowdown in consumer spending, and follows similar falls in gdp in the two previous quarters. the tokyo stock market fell after the figures were announced, but rose again on a widespread perception that the economy will recover later this year. on wednesday, the government revised growth figures from earlier in 2004 which, when taking into account performance in the most recent period, effectively tips japan into recession.

a previous estimate of 0.1% growth between july and september was downgraded to a 0.3% decline. a recession is commonly defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth, although the japanese government takes other factors into account when judging the status of its economy.

figures released by the government's cabinet office showed that gdp, on an annualised basis, fell 0.5% in the last three months of 2004. however, politicians remain upbeat about prospects for an economic boost later in the year. ""the economy has some soft patches but if you look at the bigger picture, it is in a recovery stage,"" said economic and fiscal policy minister heizo takenaka. gross domestic product measures the overall value of goods and services produced in a country. ""the economy must be assessed comprehensively and we cannot look at gdp alone,"" mr takenaka stressed.

ministers pointed to the fact that consumer spending had been depressed by one-off factors such as the unseasonably mild winter. analysts said the figures were disappointing but argued that japan's largest companies had been recording healthy profits and capital spending was on the rise. japan's economy grew 2.6% overall last year - fuelled by a strong performance in the first few months - and is forecast to see growth of 2.1% in 2005. however, the economy's fragile recovery remains dependent on an upturn in consumer spending, a fall in the value of the yen and an improvement in global economies. ""the results came in at the lower end of expectations but we shouldn't be too pessimistic about the current state and the outlook for the economy,"" said naoki iizuka, senior economist at the dai-ichi life research institute. japan's economy has seen stretches of moderate growth over the past decade but has periodically slipped back into recession.

rapper 50 cent has ended his public feud with his protege the game as the pair said they wanted to be good role models for their communities.

the row blew up when 50 cent threw the game out of his g-unit crew and accused him of being disloyal. a member of the game's entourage was reportedly shot outside a radio station where 50 cent was being interviewed. but the pair shook hands as they handed over money to music projects for new york's deprived areas on wednesday.

the game, whose real name is jayceon taylor, told a news conference: ""i want to apologise. i'm almost ashamed to have participated in the things that went on over the last few weeks."" chart-topper 50 cent, real name curtis jackson, said the truce came on the anniversary of the death of the notorious big in 1997, who was part of a volatile feud between the east and west coast rap scenes. ""we're here today to show that people can rise above the most difficult circumstances and together we can put negativity behind us,"" 50 cent said.

""a lot of people don't want to see it happen, but we're responding to the two most important groups - our family and our fans."" the boys choir of harlem got a cheque for $150,000 (â£77,800) from 50 cent, while the game handed over $103,500 (â£53,400). the game also made a contribution to the compton schools music programme. 50 cent announced he has launched the g-unity foundation ""to help people overcome obstacles and make a chance for the better in their lives"".

""game and i need to set an example in the community."" 50 cent is no stranger to feuds, with rapper ja rule among the targets for ridicule in his songs. on his latest album, released earlier this month, he turned his attentions to fat joe and nas, who have both worked with ja rule. both he and the game have admitted drug dealing in the past and have both been shot.

1947,"further rise in uk jobless total

the uk's jobless total rose for the second month in a row in december, official figures show.

the number of people out of work rose 32,000 to 1.41 million in the last three months of 2004, even as 90,000 more people were in employment. average earnings rose by 4.3% in the year to december up from november's 4.2%, the office for national statistics (ons) added. meanwhile, the benefit claimant total fell 11,000 to 813,200 last month. throughout 2004, the number of people in work increased by 296,000 to 28.52 million - the highest figure since records began in 1971.

the apparent discrepancy between rising unemployment and record numbers in work can be explained by an increase in the working population and a fall in those who are economically inactive. while the uk's jobless rate rose to 4.7% from 4.6% in the previous quarter, the rate still remains one of the lowest in the world, compared with 12.1% in germany, 10.4% in spain and 9.7% in france. but, despite more people being in work, the manufacturing sector continued to suffer, with 104,000 workers axed during the last quarter of 2004 - pushing employment in the sector to a record low of 3.24 million by the end of last year. the figures prompted some analysts to forecast that the bank of england will almost certainly raise rates this year. marc ostwald, a strategist at monument securities told reuters that while no immediate market impact could be expected, ""it is enough to underline that they (the boe) will be more hawkish on rates"".

2,"howard denies split over id cards

michael howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial labour plans to introduce id cards.

the tory leader said his front bench team had reached a ""collective view"" after holding a ""good discussion"", but admitted it was ""not an easy issue"". he had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. the lib dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next monday.

tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the id card scheme. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis, oliver letwin and tim yeo. but mr howard denied mr yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans ""stink"". he also said he was confident shadow home secretary mr davis would ""set out the position very clearly"" when he stands up to debate the matter next week. mr howard said the police had said id cards could ""help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives"". he added: ""when the police say that you have to take them seriously"".

he acknowledged there were ""good libertarian arguments"" against the cards, but said the shadow cabinet had weighed up all the ""conflicting interests"" before reaching its decision. ""i don't pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken."" he also denied he was afraid of looking ""soft"" on the issue, compared to labour. the conservatives announced their support for the government plans on monday evening.

sources within the party told the bbc mr howard had always been in favour of id cards, and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. but the tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.

they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would be able to deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. ""it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,"" a spokesman said. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten has branded the id scheme a waste of money and ""deeply flawed"". he said: ""this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues' concerns over id cards.""

the chairman of the bar council, guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the ""margins of society"" would be driven into the hands of extremists. ""what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? they are going to be stopped. if they haven't [id cards] they are going to be detained."" tory ex-minister douglas hogg said he opposed the plans for id cards branding them a ""regressive"" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. he predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of britain's ethnic minorities being stopped by police.

1020,"progress on new internet domains

by early 2005 the net could have two new domain names.

the .post and .travel net domains have been given preliminary approval by the net's administrative body. the names are just two of a total of 10 proposed domains that are being considered by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers, icann. the other proposed names include a domain for pornography, asia, mobile phones, an anti-spam domain and one for the catalan language and culture.

the .post domain is backed by the universal postal union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices.

the .travel domain would be used by hotels, travel firms, airlines, tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online. it is backed by a new york-based trade group called the travel partnership. icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted. despite this initial approval, icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service. at the same time icann is considering proposals for another eight domains. one that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a .xxx domain for pornographic websites. a similar proposal has been made many times in the past. but icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it. in 2000 icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success. three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero. others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic. in total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations. but domains that end in the .com suffix are by far the most numerous.

936,"nintendo ds makes its euro debut

nintendo's ds handheld game console has officially gone on sale in europe.

many stores around the uk opened at midnight to let keen gamers get their hands on the device. the two-screen clamshell gadget costs â£99 (149 euros) and 15 games are available for it at launch, some featuring well-known characters such as super mario and rayman. the ds spearheads nintendo's attempt to continue its dominance of the handheld gaming market.

since going on sale in japan and the us at the end of 2004, nintendo has sold almost 4m ds consoles.

part of this popularity may be due to the fact that the ds can run any of the catalogue of 700 games produced for nintendo's gameboy advance handheld. games for the ds are expected to cost between â£19 and â£29. about 130 games for the ds are in development.

as well as having two screens, one of which is controlled by touch, the ds also lets players take on up to 16 other people via wireless. a ""download play"" option means ds owners can take each other on even if only one of them owns a copy of a particular game. other ds owners can also be sent text messages and drawings. nintendo is also planning to release a media adapter for the handheld so it can play music and video. five virgin megastores and 150 game shops were expected to open early on friday morning to let people buy a ds. ""we know that customers want it as soon as it's released - and that means the minute, not the day,"" said robert quinn, game's uk sales director.

but nintendo will only have sole control of europe's handheld gaming market for a few weeks because soon sony is expected to release its psp console. although nintendo is aiming for younger players and the psp is more for older gamers, it is likely that the two firms will be competing for many of the same customers. sony's psp represents a real threat to nintendo because of the huge number of playstation owners around the world and the greater flexibility of the sleek black gadget. the psp uses small discs for games, can play music and movies without the need for add-ons and also supports short-range wireless play. when it goes on sale the psp is likely to cost between â£130 and â£200.

1079,"napster offers rented music to go

music downloading, for those that have rejected the free peer to peer services, can be a costly business.

the cost of paying even as little as 70p per track can add up, particularly for those people who own one of the new generation of players that can store thousands of songs. paying per track for music is becoming as outmoded as paying per minute for internet access and alternative monthly or yearly subscription models are springing up as a more convenient, and ultimately cheaper way of owning music.

""music fans are moving away from buying the traditional bundled package of a dozen or more songs that we used to call an album to newer ways that fit their lifestyle; either single tracks or subscriptions services,"" said paul myers, chief executive of wippit, a uk-based music download service. while itunes is doing good business with its sales of individual tracks to ipod owners, others are questioning whether the concept of owning music is even valid in the digital age. napster is due to launch a new rental subscription service - dubbed napster to go in the uk in the next few months. the service can be used on players that support microsoft windows latest digital rights management technology known as janus. this includes players made by samsung, rio and creative.

currently on offer in beta-version in the us, the service costs $15 per month for unlimited downloads. the technology ensures that music downloaded to the player only remains playable while the user subscribes to the service. users need to update their license on a monthly basis or the tunes will no longer play.

this has outraged some digital music lovers, especially as napster already offers a cheaper service for downloading music to the pc. napster claims the higher price is a result of record labels charging more for the to-go service and says it also offers ""greater value"" for customers. mr myers is not convinced a rental model will work for consumers. ""we've been offering our unlimited music subscription service for more than three years now and our customers know what they want. format interoperability, excellent value and the reassurance that music purchased from wippit is theirs to keep and enjoy on whatever device they choose,"" he said.

sony, ibm and toshiba, who have been working on the cell processor for three years, unveiled the chip on monday. it is being designed for use in graphics workstations, the new playstation console, and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip. the chip will run at speeds of greater than 4 ghz, the firms said. by comparison, rival chip maker intel's fastest processor runs at 3.8 ghz. details of the chip were released at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco. the new processor is set to ignite a fresh battle between intel and the cell consortium over which processor sits at the centre of digital products. the playstation 3 is expected in 2006, while toshiba plans to incorporate it into high-end televisions next year. ibm has said it will sell a workstation with the chip starting later this year.

cell is comprised of several computing engines, or cores. a core based on ibm's power architecture controls eight ""synergistic"" processing centres. in all, they can simultaneously carry out 10 instruction sequences, compared with two for current intel chips.

later this year, intel and advanced micro devices plan to release their own ""multicore"" chips, which also increase the number of instructions that can be executed at once. the cell's specifications suggest the playstation 3 will offer a significant boost in graphics capabilities but analysts cautioned that not all the features in a product announcement will find their way into systems. ""any new technology like this has two components,"" said steve kleynhans, an analyst with meta group. he said: ""it has the vision of what it could be because you need the big vision to sell it. ""then there's the reality of how it's really going to be used, which generally is several levels down the chain from there.""

while the playstation 3 is likely to be the first mass-market product to use cell, the chip's designers have said the flexible architecture means that it would be useful for a wide range of applications, from servers to mobile phones. initial devices are unlikely to be any smaller than a games console, however, because the first version of the cell will run hot enough to need a cooling fan. and while marketing speak describes the chip as a ""supercomputer"" - it remains significantly slower than the slowest computer on the list of the world's top 500 supercomputers. ibm said cell was ""os neutral"" and would support multiple operating systems simultaneously but designers would not confirm if microsoft's windows was among those tested with the chip. if cell is to challenge intel's range of chips in the marketplace, it will need to find itself inside pcs, which predominantly run using windows.

2060,"millions 'to lose textile jobs'

millions of the world's poorest textile trade workers will lose their jobs under new trade rules to be introduced in the new year, a charity has warned.

the world trade organisation (wto) is to end its multi-fibre agreement (mfa) on midnight of 31 december. christian aid condemned the move, saying it would see almost a million jobs in bangladesh alone being axed. however, supporters of the change claim it will mean increased efficiency and lower costs for western consumers.

it will also see more jobs created in india and china, advocates argue. the wto said that many developing countries support the end of quotas and stressed that funding was available to countries such as bangladesh to help them make the transition to a fully liberalised market. ""there will be a period of adjustment required,"" said wto spokesman keith rockwell. ""some countries will do better than others but there is no one who is suggesting that no developing country will do well out of this. ""some countries where it may appear that orders will dry up have seen orders surging and there are many companies who will continue with existing trading relationships.""

christian aid has called on british firms not to simply ""cut and run"" but look after their workers, in a new report called rags to riches to rags.

it added that with few employment alternatives available many sacked garment workers could end up in far worse jobs - with some of the mainly female workers forced into the sex trade. the wto itself has warned that as many as 27 million jobs could be lost as a result of liberalisation in the textile industry. some of the world's fastest developing countries which rely on textile exports to build growth - for example in bangladesh textiles account for almost 85% of the country's exports and the industry employs around 1.5 million people. the mfa pact has helped developing countries get a bigger share of the world market. ""the losers in this new trade landscape will be some of the most vulnerable workers in countries such as bangladesh, cambodia, sri lanka and nepal,"" andrew pendleton, christian aid's head of trade policy, said. ""they will be hard-pressed to cope when garment industries there lose their protection. ""we are deeply concerned that the new year will spell misery for huge numbers of garment workers."" the wto said there was no consenus among its members to retain the quotas and emphasised that funding was available to countries such as bangladesh to help them adjust to the liberalised market.

it added that the impact of the changes for workers most affected by the shake-up had not been considered, adding such seismic changes to policy should ""put the interests of poor people first - rather than simply aiming to liberalise markets at any cost"". while the current mfa was not perfect, its did allow third world countries like bangladesh to get onto the first rung of industrial development, christian aid said. ""international trade must not be governed by a 'race to the bottom' that pitches one set of poor people against another,"" mr pendleton added.

2124,"saudi ncci's shares soar

shares in saudi arabia's national company for cooperative insurance (ncci) soared on their first day of trading in riyadh.

they were trading 84% above the offer price on monday, changing hands at 372 riyals ($99; â£53) after topping 400 early in the day. demand for the insurer's debut shares was strong - 12 times what was on sale. the listing was part of the country's plans to open up its insurance market and boost demand in the sector. deregulation is expected to boost demand for accident and damage cover.

previously, only ncci has been legally allowed to offer insurance products within saudi arabia. however, the authorities have turned a blind eye to the many other firms selling insurance. saudi arabia now wants a fully functioning insurance industry and is introducing legislation that will clamp down on unauthorised companies. policy-makers also want to make having insurance more of a requirement, but first have to take steps to boost public confidence in the system, analysts said. as a result, ncci is being developed as the industry's flagship firm - publicly-listed, with audited accounts. saudi arabia sold 7 million ncci shares, or about 70% of the company's total capital last month. more than 800,000 applicants got 9 shares each for 205 riyals apiece.

apple had been unwilling to raise the cost of the single in line with other download services, said band aid. but the single is now on sale for 79p - the usual cost of a song from itunes - with apple donating a further 70p to the charity for each song downloaded. a copy of the original 1984 song is also available for download at 79p - with all proceeds going to the charity.

more than 72,000 copies of the new band aid single were sold on its first day of release on monday, according to sales figures. the track has become the fastest-selling single of the year so far, shifting more copies than the rest of the top 30 combined, hmv claimed. dido, robbie williams and chris martin are among those featured on the new version of do they know it's christmas?, which is raising money to fight hunger in africa. if the track sold 500,000 copies, more than â£1m would be raised for charity. the cd is being sold for â£3.99, with hmv, virgin and woolworths all donating their profits.

745,"bortolami predicts dour contest

italy skipper marco bortolami believes saturday's six nations contest against scotland will be a scrappy encounter.

with both sides looking for their first win of the championship, the third-round game at murrayfield has been billed as a wooden-spoon decider. and bortolami feels the edinburgh contest could end up being a bruising battle of the packs. ""it will not be a pretty game because both teams are desperate to gain their first win,"" said the lock forward. italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the six nations in 2000, but two of those have come against scotland. this year, italy opened up with a stubborn display against ireland but ended up losing 28-17.

however, they were thoroughly outplayed by an impressive welsh side in rome last time out. now the italians travel to edinburgh hoping to claim their first away win in the six nations. ""scotland played extremely well against france in paris but not so well when ireland came to edinburgh,"" said bortolami. ""we are still very disappointed with our last game against wales in rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs. ""as a nation, our quest is to be respected as a team worthy of a place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games.""

583,"ruddock backs yapp's credentials

wales coach mike ruddock says john yapp has what it takes as an international.

the 21-year-old blues prop is the only uncapped player in wales' six nations squad, gaining a chance in the absence of ospreys loose-head duncan jones. ""john is a young man with a big future. he has been playing with the blues for two years and has racked up mileage on his playing clock,"" said ruddock. ""he has international size, is a big, physical lad and a good ball-carrier with a high tackle-count."" ruddock's assessment was backed up by yapp's coach at the blues, former wales and lions prop dai young.

""john's been on an upward curve all season and is going from strength to strength,"" young told bbc sport wales. ""his ball carrying gives us good go-forward, he impresses in defence and his work-rate is excellent. ""he's working hard on his scrummaging technique, which he is keen to improve to become a destroyer on the loose-head. ""to be fair to him he's not quite there with the scrummaging yet, but nobody can fault his effort, commitment and attitude. ""john's a very strong man and is eager for the challenge, if he's pitched in he won't let anyone down. ""he's developing quickly, but i hope he isn't pushed too quickly in a way that would hurt his development.""

ruddock hopes that the selection of yapp and dragons lock ian gough - out of the international reckoning since falling out with former coach steve hansen - will send a message to other players in wales. ""john and ian have been rewarded for impressing during the heineken cup competition,"" said ruddock. ""both of them have played well, and we want to send a message out that consistently playing well gets you in the squad. ""we believe this is an exciting squad representing traditional values of welsh rugby, and based on the performances in the november internationals. ""we have strength and experience up front, and well-recognised talent, pace and skill behind. ""the management team just want to get hold of the players and get out on the training pitch at the moment. ""they are all due in on sunday, and that's when the hard work starts.""

545,"verdict delay for greek sprinters

greek athletics' governing body has postponed by two weeks the judgement on sprinters costas kenteris and katerina thanou for missing doping tests.

the pair are facing lengthy bans for the missed tests, including one on the eve of last year's athens olympics. they were set to learn their fate by the end of february, but late evidence from them has pushed the date back. ""a decision is now expected by around mid-march,"" said one of their lawyers, michalis dimitrakopoulos. kenteris, 31, who won the men's 200m title at the 2000 sydney games and thanou, 30, who won the women's 100m silver medal in sydney, face a maximum two-year ban if found guilty. the athletes, who spectacularly withdrew from the athens olympics, have been suspended by the international association of athletics federations (iaaf) for missing the three tests. the iaaf said the sprinters had failed to provide samples for tests in tel aviv, chicago and athens and ordered greek athletic's governing body, segas, to hold a disciplinary inquiry. the athletes also face a criminal hearing in greece over the missed drugs tests and have been charged with faking a motorcycle accident on the day of the athens test, which led to them spending four days in hospital. following the final hearing in late january, the athletes sounded confident they would be acquitted. ""i am confident and optimistic,"" thanou had said at the time. ""we presented new evidence to the committee that they were not aware of."" it was not clear what this new evidence was.

1395,"how the academy awards flourished

the 77th annual academy awards are taking place on 27 february with the stars of the movie-making world once again holding their breath to discover who will be showered with the honours this year. but from humble beginnings, how did the modern day extravaganza become the behemoth it is today?

how it all started the first academy awards were handed out in 1929 at a comparatively low-key dinner held at the hollywood roosevelt hotel - just over the road from their modern day home.

just 250 guests attended with ticket prices at $5.

the first film to win was wings, which starred clara bow in the only silent movie to win the big award. for the first 10 years or so, the winners list was handed to the newspapers so they could publish them at 11pm, but in 1940 the winners were published in the los angeles times at 8.45pm meaning guests entering the ceremony knew already knew the results. as a result the sealed envelope system was introduced, leading to the secrecy and suspense-filled night that happens today. when and where the tradition of holding the awards at a banquet continued until 1942 but with increasing interest came a growing guest list and it became impractical to host it as a dinner.

the ceremonies were then transferred to theatres with the famous grauman's chinese theatre the first to host the expanded event. other venues included the dorothy chandler pavilion and the shrine auditorium. they are now held at the kodak theatre, which opened in 2002 just across the road from its original home and holds 6,000 people. until 1954 they were held on a thursday, then swapped around from monday to wednesday before sunday night was settled on, although the month swapped from may to april to march and now its current month of february. the first televised ceremony was in 1953, with bob hope as the mc. who was oscar? there is no solid evidence as to how the trophy became to be known as oscar.

one popular story is that academy librarian margaret herrick said the statue looked like her uncle oscar. a journalist apparently overheard this conversation and used the phrase in an article.

the first time it is thought to have been used in print was when columnist sidney skolsky used it to describe katherine hepburn's first best actress win in 1934. the academy officially adopted the nickname in 1939. the trophy was designed by mgm art director cedric gibbons. since its inception 2,530 oscars have been handed out. in support of the war effort, the academy handed out plaster oscar statuettes during wwii. after the war, winners exchanged the plaster awards for the real thing. fifty-five statues were stolen in en route to the awards in 2000, 52 were recovered nine days later. winners were unaffected as a new batch was rushed out. who sits in judgement? the academy was set up in 1927 as a non-profit organisation with 36 members from different film disciplines. douglas fairbanks sr was the first president and oversaw the first awards. there are now 5,700 members of the academy - with membership by invitation only to those who are seen to have achieved distinction in the movies and are therefore seen as fit to judge their peers. some of the criteria for admittance includes: film credits that reflect the high standards of the academy, receipt of an academy award nomination, achievement of unique distinction, earning of special merit, or making an outstanding contribution to film. the stars who left empty-handed while many of the biggest films and movie-makers have been honoured by the academy, there is still surprise at those that did not receive any nominations that later went on to become classics.

among the overlooked films were hobson's choice, dirty harry, the 39 steps, the searchers and king kong. actors that failed to win for their iconic roles included al jolson in the jazz singer (1927), humphrey bogart in casablanca (1944), gene kelly in singing in the rain (1952) and henry fonda in 12 angry men (1957). alfred hitchcock also failed to win an award despite five nominations. his enduring influence on the horror genre was finally recognised with an honorary gong in 1968. the show always goes on not even war has halted the glittering hollywood event. there were calls for it to be cancelled in 2003 during the war in iraq, but as it didn't stop during world war ii or the vietnam war.

documentary winner michael moore ensured nobody forgot about the iraq war though and used his acceptance speech to criticise the american invasion. the ceremony was muted with the glitz turned down and many female stars opting for demure dark dresses. the ceremony has been postponed on three occasions. los angeles floods in 1938 saw it put back a week. the death of martin luther king saw it postponed for two days in 1968 as a mark of respect and there was a 24-hour delay following the assassination attempt on president ronald reagan. controversies and other gaffes three people have refused oscars, including actor george c scott who said the whole thing was ""demeaning"". writer dudley nichols refused his academy award in 1935 for his screenplay for the insider because the writers' guild was striking at the time. marlon brando turned down his best actor oscar for the godfather in 1973 in protest as hollywood's apparent discrimination against native american people. he sent along a woman called sacheen littlefeather to collect his award. she was later revealed to be native american actress maria cruz.

the following year robert opal interrupted proceedings when he streaked, flashing a peace sign as well as everything else. the tv network managed to pan away and avoid too much nudity. opal was murdered in 1979. frank capra was the butt of one major gaffe in 1934 when the host opened out best picture envelope and declared ""come on up and get it, frank"" to which frank capra bounded up to the stage before realising that he had meant frank lloyd had won for cavalcade.

capra vowed he would never to go the awards again but went the following year to collect his award for it happened one night.

381,"student 'inequality' exposed

teenagers from well-off backgrounds are six times more likely to go to university than those from the most deprived areas, a report says.

the higher education funding council for england said more people went to university between 1994 and 2000. but the percentage of poorer students ""hardly changed at all"", said its chief executive, sir howard newby. increasingly more women than men went to university, while tuition fees and student loans made no major difference.

the hefce report, drawing on child benefits data, said teenagers in the richest areas could expect a better than 50% chance of going to university, while in the poorest neighbourhoods it was 10%. participation at constituency level ranged from 69% in kensington and chelsea, 65% in the city of london and westminster and 62% in sheffield hallam, down to 10% in bristol south and leeds central and 8% in nottingham north and sheffield brightside.

sir howard said the report highlighted the ""entrenched divisions"" between rich and poor areas, but added it was a social as much as an educational problem. he told bbc news: ""we know, once children from deprived backgrounds get into university, they do very well. in fact surprisingly more go into postgraduate study than those from more affluent backgrounds. ""the issue is, i think, one of raising aspirations amongst those families and those communities that university is something for them and not for other people.""

he said by the time universities traditionally dealt with pupils, between the ages of 16 and 18, it was too late. instead they should be reaching out to communities and schools much earlier, even down to primary school level, to persuade them a university education was something they could aspire to, he said. but while the report revealed stark inequalities and exposed the extent of the challenge, there were some encouraging findings, he added.

tuition fees and student loans in england and wales - and the different fee regime in scotland - did not seem to have affected the choices of young people, even the poorest. the report also showed women were 18% more likely than men to enter higher education in 2000 - up from 6% in 1994. in the poorest areas, the gap was 30% in women's favour and growing faster than anywhere else. the higher education minister, kim howells, said: ""we are working in schools to raise the attainment and aspiration of young people in disadvantaged areas."" higher standards in schools would lead to greater participation in higher education. from 2006 upfront tuition fees in england would be removed, with grants for the less well off. the shadow education secretary, tim collins, said: ""it is clear from this report that children from disadvantaged areas are far more likely to have encountered poor standards in their secondary education. ""tackling these must be the top priority for any government looking to improve university access."" the group which represents university vice-chancellors, universities uk, said the new system of deferred fees in england, due to start in 2006, with grants and bursaries for poorer students, would encourage more of them to go into higher education. the national union of students argued the opposite - that the situation was ""likely to get much worse, with poorer students being restricted in choice and having to make decisions based on their financial situation rather than aspiration"".

2200,"euronext joins bid battle for lse

pan-european stock market euronext has approached the london stock exchange (lse) about a possible takeover bid.

""the approach is at an early stage and therefore does not require a response at this point,"" lse said. talks with the european stock market and with rival bidder deutsche boerse will continue, the lse said. last week, the group rejected a â£1.3bn ($2.5bn) takeover offer from deutsche boerse, claiming that it undervalued the business. lse saw its shares surge 4.9% to a new high of 583p in early trade, following the announcement on monday.

the offer follows widespread media speculation that euronext would make an offer for lse. experts now widely expect a bidding war for europe's biggest stock market, which lists stocks with a total capitalisation of â£1.4 trillion, to break out. commentators say that a deal with euronext, which owns the liffe derivatives exchange in london and combines the paris, amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges, could potentially offer the lse more cost savings than a deal with deutsche boerse.

a weekend report in the telegraph had quoted an unnamed executive at euronext as saying the group would make a cash bid to trump deutsche boerse's offer. ""because we already own liffe in london, the cost savings available to us from a merger are far greater than for deutsche boerse,"" the newspaper quoted the executive as saying. euronext chief executive jean-francois theodore is reported to have already held private talks with lse's chief executive clara furse. further reports had suggested that euronext could make an offer in excess of the lse's 533p a share closing price on friday. however, euronext said it could not guarantee ""at this stage"" that a firm offer would be made for lse. there has been extensive speculation about a possible takeover of the company since an attempted merger with deutsche boerse failed in 2000.

1952,"deadline nears for fiat-gm deal

fiat and general motors (gm) have until midnight on 1 february to settle a disagreement over a potential takeover.

the deadline marks the point at which fiat will gain the right to sell its car division to gm, part of an alliance agreed in 2000. gm, whose own european operations are losing money, no longer wants to own the unprofitable fiat unit. reports of deadlocked talks sent fiat shares down 1.2% on tuesday, after monday's 4% gain on hopes of a payoff. the us firm is thought to be offering about $2bn (â£1.06bn) to extricate itself from the arrangement. it has argued the deal was voided by fiat's decision to sell off fiat's finance arm and halve gm's stake via a capital-raising effort.

the 2000 deal resulted from a race between gm and daimlerchrysler to ally with fiat. the german firm wanted to buy fiat outright. but gianni agnelli, the godfather of the group, wanted to keep control, and preferred gm's offer to buy a 20% stake and give fiat the right to sell in the future, known as a ""put option"". since then, however, fiat cars have lost market share and the firm has piled up losses, while a plan to raise new money in 2003 cut gm's stake in half to 10%. for its part, gm's european units opel and saab have both had trouble, with opel management threatening to cut 12,000 jobs. ""the last thing they need is additional production capacity in europe,"" said patrick juchemich, auto analyst at sal oppenheim bank.

1244,"intel unveils laser breakthrough

intel has said it has found a way to put a silicon-based laser on a chip, raising hopes of much faster networks.

scientists at intel have overcome a fundamental problem that before now has prevented silicon being used to generate and amplify laser light. the breakthrough should make it easier to interconnect data networks with the chips that process the information. the intel researchers said products exploiting the breakthrough should appear by the end of the decade.

""we've overcome a fundamental limit,"" said dr mario paniccia, director of intel's photonics technology lab. writing in the journal nature, dr paniccia - and colleagues haisheng rong, richard jones, ansheng liu, oded cohen, dani hak and alexander fang - show how they have made a continuous laser from the same material used to make computer processors. currently, says dr paniccia, telecommunications equipment that amplifies the laser light that travels down fibre optic cables is very expensive because of the exotic materials, such as gallium arsenide, used to make it.

telecommunications firms and chip makers would prefer to use silicon for these light-moving elements because it is cheap and many of the problems of using it in high-volume manufacturing have been solved. ""we're trying to take our silicon competency in manufacturing and apply it to new areas,"" said dr paniccia. while work has been done to make some of the components that can move light around, before now silicon has not successfully been used to generate or amplify the laser light pulses used to send data over long distances. this is despite the fact that silicon is a much better amplifier of light pulses than the form of the material used in fibre optic cables. this improved amplification is due to the crystalline structure of the silicon used to make computer chips. dr paniccia said that the structure of silicon meant that when laser light passed through it, some colliding photons rip electrons off the atoms within the material. ""it creates a cloud of electrons sitting in the silicon and that absorbs all the light,"" he said. but the intel researchers have found a way to suck away these errant electrons and turn silicon into a material that can both generate and amplify laser light. even better, the laser light produced in this way can, with the help of easy-to-make filters, be tuned across a very wide range of frequencies. semi-conductor lasers made before now have only produced light in a narrow frequency ranges. the result could be the close integration of the fibre optic cables that carry data as light with the computer chips that process it. dr paniccia said the work was the one of several steps needed if silicon was to be used to make components that could carry and process light in the form of data pulses. ""it's a technical validation that it can work,"" he said.

citizenship ceremonies could be introduced for people celebrating their 18th birthday, charles clarke has said.

the idea will be tried as part of an overhaul of the way government approaches ""inclusive citizenship"" particularly for ethnic minorities. a pilot scheme based on ceremonies in australia will start in october. mr clarke said it would be a way of recognising young people reaching their voting age when they also gain greater independence from parents. britain's young black and asian people are to be encouraged to learn about the nation's heritage as part of the government's new race strategy which will also target specific issues within different ethnic minority groups. officials say the home secretary wants young people to feel they belong and to understand their ""other cultural identities"" alongside being british. the launch follows a row about the role of faith schools in britain. on monday school inspection chief david bell, accused some islamic schools of failing to teach pupils about their obligations to british society.

the muslim council of britain said ofsted boss mr bell's comments were ""highly irresponsible"". the home office started work on its community cohesion and race equality strategy last year and the outcome, launched on wednesday, is called 'improving opportunity, strengthening society'. it is aimed at tackling racism, exclusion, segregation and the rise in political and religious extremism. ""it represents a move away from the one-size-fits-all approach to focus on specifics within cultural groups,"" said a home office spokesman. ""it is not right to say that if you are from a black or ethnic minority group you must be disadvantaged."" the spokesman highlighted specific issues that affect particular communities - for example people of south asian origin tend to suffer from a high incidence of heart disease.

""it is about drilling down and focusing on these sorts of problems,"" the spokesman added. launching the initiative mr clarke said enormous progress had been made on race issues in recent years. he added: ""but while many members of black and minority ethnic communities are thriving, some may still find it harder to succeed in employment or gain access to healthcare, education or housing. ""this strategy sets out the government's commitment to doing more to identify and respond to the specific needs of minorities in our society."" some 8% of the uk population described themselves as coming from a non-white ethnic minority in the 2001 census.

the downing street strategy unit in 2003 said people from indian and chinese backgrounds were doing well on average, often outperforming white people in education and earnings. but those of pakistani, bangladeshi and black caribbean origin were significantly more likely to be unemployed and earn less than whites, it said. the home office wants more initiatives which try to promote a sense of belonging by encouraging young people to take part in voluntary work. the programmes are designed to support the citizenship lessons already taking place in schools.

an english hospital has suspended plans to stop treating welsh patients who have waited more than three months.

hereford county hospital had earlier said that from the new year patients waiting longer than this would be taken off waiting lists for hip and knee operations. gps in wales had feared patients could be pushed to the back of another queue. but after talks with powys health board the hospital called off its plan until health chiefs meet early in january. hereford hospital trust caused an outcry when it sent out a letter telling patients that for financial and administrative reasons it planned to turn down some orthopaedic patients. shocked health officials in powys said this meant they would be left with the prospect of patients and doctors having to find new appointments in other hospitals. andy williams, chief executive of powys local health board, had said it was ""a totally unacceptable way to behave"".

mr williams had said he did not think it was a welsh-english issue, but said hereford hospital was ""struggling financially and trying to pass the problem back to powys"". he had told bbc radio wales: ""i have written straight back to the trust... to insist they withdraw this threat and treat the patients i am paying them to treat."" but after the hospital had agreed to the suspension, mr williams said he was optimistic a compromise could be reached which would ensure welsh patients continued to be treated there. he said the problem had been caused by the difference in waiting time targets between england and wales.

the target is 12 months for welsh patients, but just three months in england. the contract with the powys health board was worth â£7m a year for the hospital and accounts for 12% of its patients. in a statement before the suspension of the idea, the welsh assembly government said the situation was ""unacceptable"".

labour's leadership put on a show of unity at a campaign poster launch after mps criticised tony blair and gordon brown over reports of their rift.

mr brown was joined at the launch by john prescott and alan milburn, the man controversially put in charge of election planning by mr blair. a private meeting on monday saw normally loyal mps warn that feuding could jeopardise their election hopes. it follows a new book charting disputes between prime minister and chancellor.

the event was the first time mr milburn has shared a platform with the chancellor since taking mr brown's traditional poll planning role. but the pair chatted amicably and mr brown insisted he was happy with his current campaign task. asked about how he would deal with claims that he did not trust the prime minister, mr brown replied: ""you can see that our record on the economy is about the british people trusting us to run the economy.""

he refused to comment on the new book, saying nobody should be distracted from the business of government. mr brown later told reporters: ""of course i trust the prime minister."" downing street cited that comment when reporters' suggested mr brown had pointedly failed to deny claims he had once told mr blair: ""there is nothing you could ever say to me now that i could ever believe"". labour's new posters say britain is enjoying the lowest inflation since the 1960s, lowest unemployment for 29 years and the lowest mortgage rates for 40 years. they urge voters not to let the tories take things backwards. mr milburn promised a poll campaign ""which is upbeat, confident and above all else optimistic about the future of our country"".

conservative co-chairman liam fox derided the photo call, saying: ""the show of unity was the worst acting i have seen since prisoner cell block h."" labour had broken promises by raising taxes 66 times and brought the slowest economic growth in the english-speaking world, he said.

the prime minister and chancellor faced backbench discontent at monday's meeting of the parliamentary labour party over claims made in journalist robert peston's new book. mr blair told mps and peers: ""i know from everyone here, in cabinet and government, nothing is going to get in the way of a unified labour party with a unified position and winning the third term people desperately need."" labour's paul flynn said the pair had had a ""scorching"" from mps.

british film director sir alan parker has been made an officer in the order of arts and letters, one of france's highest cultural honours.

sir alan received his decoration in paris on wednesday from french culture minister renaud donnedieu de vabres. ""you have explored the possibilities of film with an immense talent,"" mr de vabres said as he presented the award. parker praised french films, saying: ""hollywood, which created modern cinema, uses it only as a commodity."" he told the minister: ""i am honoured to be thus distinguished by france, the flag carrier of cinema throughout the world."" sir alan's films include oscar-winning fame plus midnight express and the commitments.

a founding member of the director's guild of great britain, he is a former chairman of the uk film council and on the board of the british film institute.

2209,"china's shanda buys stake in sina

chinese online game operator shanda interactive entertainment has bought a 20% stake in sina, the country's biggest internet portal firm.

the move may be a precursor to a full takeover, with analysts saying that a better-known international firm may also now show an interest in sina. shanda said that it may boost its stake in sina, even buying it outright. a merger would create a firm that offers online role-playing games, news, entertainment and wireless messaging.

sina said that the purchase of a stake by shanda would have no impact on its business.

the board of directors said in a statement that it would ""continue to act in the best interests of all the company stakeholders, including shareholders, employees and customers"". both companies are listed on the new york stock exchange's (nyse) technology-dominated nasdaq index. in a filing with the us securities and exchange commission, sina said its shares were purchased between 12 january and 10 february for about $230m. rumours about a possible takeover boosted sina's shares by more than 10% on friday. they added an extra 6.4% to $27.24 in electronic trading after the trading session had finished. and there may be more gains amid bid speculation when trading resumes in new york on tuesday after monday's public holiday, analysts forecast. ""there could still be some potential parties that could still counter bid,"" said wallace cheung, an analyst at dbs vickers. ""even though shanda has 20% of sina, they still have quite a long way to take full control."" however, mr cheung noted that a foreign company trying to take control of a chinese internet portal firm, with its ability to filter and pass on news, may not be viewed very favourably by beijing.

264,"brown outlines third term vision

gordon brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of new labour's next general election bid.

he said ensuring every child in britain had the best start in life could be a legacy to match the nhs's creation. the chancellor has previously planned the party's election strategy but this time the role will be filled by alan milburn - a key ally of tony blair. the premier insisted mr brown will have a key role in labour's campaign, and praised his handling of the economy.

writing in the guardian newspaper, mr brown outlined his view of the direction new labour should be taking. ""as our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear, labour's ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment; not just attacking ignorance, disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education, good health and sustainable communities."" bbc political editor andrew marr said that mr brown's article was ""a warning shot"" to mr blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process. ""it was, as always, coded and careful... but entirely deliberate,"" was mr marr's assessment. the prime minister was asked about mr brown's article and about his election role when he appeared on bbc radio 4's today programme. mr blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor's role would be ""central"". mr blair argued that under new labour the country had changed for the better and that was ""in part"" because of mr brown's management of the economy. and he pledged childcare would be a ""centrepiece"" of labour's manifesto. he also predicted the next general election will be a ""tough, tough fight"" for new labour. but the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about 5 may. mr blair said he was taking ""nothing for granted"" ahead of the vote - warning that the tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut labour's majority instead of hoping for an outright win.

1872,"industrial output falls in japan

japanese industrial output fell in october while unemployment rose, casting further doubt on the strength of the country's economic recovery.

production dropped 1.6% in october, reflecting a decline in exports, while unemployment levels edged up 0.1% to 4.7%, slightly higher than forecast. the economy has grown for six quarters but growth slowed dramatically in the last quarter amid weaker global demand. japan's government remains optimistic due to strong domestic demand.

analysts had been forecasting a 0.1% rise in month on month industrial output.

according to figures from the ministry of economy, trade and industry (meti), the decline was led by a fall in demand for electronic parts for mobile phones and digital televisions. although inventories fell 0.7% month on month, they were 36% higher than a year ago. ""it's a sign that the economy's adjustment phase is stronger than expected,"" said takashi yamanaka, an economist with ufj bank. japan downgraded its overall economic assessment earlier this month for the first time in a year.

growth slowed to 0.3% in the quarter ending september 30, down from 6.3% in the first quarter of 2004. experts believe the economy -which stagnated for most of the 1990s -may be entering a softer patch on the back of rising oil prices and the falling dollar. japanese government officials played down the latest data, arguing that domestic consumer demand was still resilient. ""the outlook for november is positive so i don't think one can say that conditions have worsened just because of the fall in october,"" said a meti official. despite the rise in unemployment, jobless figures are still some way below historical highs of recent years. the comparatively weak economic date preyed on shares with the nikkei down 1% in afternoon trade.

the us budget deficit is set to hit a worse-than-expected $368bn (â£197bn) this year, officials said on tuesday.

the cost of military operations still needs to be factored in, with analysts saying the deficit could end up a further $100bn in the red. past congressional budget office (cbo) forecasts said there would be a $348bn shortfall in the 2005 fiscal year. in recent months, the dollar has weakened amid market jitters about the size of the budget and trade deficits. in november, the gap between us exports and imports widened to more than $60bn, a record figure. the cbo says it envisages a further ""orderly"" decline in the greenback over the next two years as the twin deficit drives dollar investors away. but the non-partisan fiscal watchdog notes the declines will help exporters and boost us economic growth.

the budget deficit hit a record $412bn in the 12 months to 30 september 2004, after reaching $377bn in the previous fiscal year. the cbo also forecast a total shortfall of $855bn for the years from 2006 to 2015, an improvement on previous projections. however, analysts say the new figures fail to take into account the potential $2-$3.8 trillion costs of the president's plan to revamp state pensions and extend tax cuts. the figure could also be worsened by any further military costs. republicans have blamed the size of the deficit on slow economic conditions after the 11 september attacks and ongoing military operations in iraq and afghanistan. one of president george w bush's election pledges was to halve the budget deficit within five years. but democrats have accused the president of excluding iraq-related costs from previous budgets to meet the aim of reducing the deficit, a charge which the administration denies. on tuesday, the us administration asked congress for additional funds for military operations.

971,"digital guru floats sub-$100 pc

nicholas negroponte, chairman and founder of mit's media labs, says he is developing a laptop pc that will go on sale for less than $100 (â£53).

he told the bbc world service programme go digital he hoped it would become an education tool in developing countries. he said one laptop per child could be "" very important to the development of not just that child but now the whole family, village and neighbourhood"". he said the child could use the laptop like a text book. he described the device as a stripped down laptop, which would run a linux-based operating system, ""we have to get the display down to below $20, to do this we need to rear project the image rather than using an ordinary flat panel.

""the second trick is to get rid of the fat , if you can skinny it down you can gain speed and the ability to use smaller processors and slower memory."" the device will probably be exported as a kit of parts to be assembled locally to keep costs down. mr negroponte said this was a not for profit venture, though he recognised that the manufacturers of the components would be making money. in 1995 mr negroponte published the bestselling being digital, now widely seen as predicting the digital age. the concept is based on experiments in the us state of maine, where children were given laptop computers to take home and do their work on.

while the idea was popular amongst the children, it initially received some resistance from the teachers and there were problems with laptops getting broken. however, mr negroponte has adapted the idea to his own work in cambodia where he set up two schools together with his wife and gave the children laptops. ""we put in 25 laptops three years ago , only one has been broken, the kids cherish these things, it's also a tv a telephone and a games machine, not just a textbook."" mr negroponte wants the laptops to become more common than mobile phones but conceded this was ambitious. ""nokia make 200 million cell phones a year, so for us to claim we're going to make 200 million laptops is a big number, but we're not talking about doing it in three or five years, we're talking about months."" he plans to be distributing them by the end of 2006 and is already in discussion with the chinese education ministry who are expected to make a large order. ""in china they spend $17 per child per year on textbooks. that's for five or six years, so if we can distribute and sell laptops in quantities of one million or more to ministries of education that's cheaper and the marketing overheads go away.""

german business confidence fell in february knocking hopes of a speedy recovery in europe's largest economy.

munich-based research institute ifo said that its confidence index fell to 95.5 in february from 97.5 in january, its first decline in three months. the study found that the outlook in both the manufacturing and retail sectors had worsened. observers had been hoping that a more confident business sector would signal that economic activity was picking up.

""we're surprised that the ifo index has taken such a knock,"" said dz bank economist bernd weidensteiner. ""the main reason is probably that the domestic economy is still weak, particularly in the retail trade."" economy and labour minister wolfgang clement called the dip in february's ifo confidence figure ""a very mild decline"". he said that despite the retreat, the index remained at a relatively high level and that he expected ""a modest economic upswing"" to continue.

germany's economy grew 1.6% last year after shrinking in 2003. however, the economy contracted by 0.2% during the last three months of 2004, mainly due to the reluctance of consumers to spend. latest indications are that growth is still proving elusive and ifo president hans-werner sinn said any improvement in german domestic demand was sluggish. exports had kept things going during the first half of 2004, but demand for exports was then hit as the value of the euro hit record levels making german products less competitive overseas. on top of that, the unemployment rate has been stuck at close to 10% and manufacturing firms, including daimlerchrysler, siemens and volkswagen, have been negotiating with unions over cost cutting measures. analysts said that the ifo figures and germany's continuing problems may delay an interest rate rise by the european central bank. eurozone interest rates are at 2%, but comments from senior officials have recently focused on the threat of inflation, prompting fears that interest rates may rise.

2129,"yukos seeks court action on sale

yukos will return to a us court on wednesday to seek sanctions against baikal finance group, the little-known firm which has bought its main asset.

yukos has said it will sue baikal and others involved in the sale of yuganskneftegas for $20bn in damages. yukos' us lawyers will attempt to have baikal assets frozen after the russian government ignored a us court order last week blocking the sale. baikal's background and its motives for buying the unit are still unclear.

russian newspapers have claimed that baikal - which bought the yuganskneftegas production unit for $9.4bn (261bn roubles, â£4.8bn) on sunday at a state provoked auction - has strong links with surgutneftegas, russia's fourth-biggest oil producer. many observers believe that the unit, which produces 60% of yukos' oil output, could ultimately fall into the hands of surgutneftegas or even gazprom, the state gas firm which opted out of the auction.

the russian government forced the sale of yukos' most lucrative asset as part of its action to enforce a $27bn back tax bill it says the company owes. yukos' us lawyers claim the auction was illegal because the firm had filed for bankruptcy and therefore its assets were now under the protection of us bankruptcy law which has worldwide jurisdiction. on wednesday, yukos will also seek further legal remedies to prevent the break-up of the group. ""we believe the auction was illegal and we intend to pursue all legal recourses available to us,"" yukos spokesman mike lake told agence france press. ""if it exports that oil, it will be marketing a stolen product,"" he added. the future ownership of yuganksneftegas remains unclear amid widespread suggestions that baikal was established as a front for other interests.

speaking on tuesday, president putin said baikal was owned by individual investors who planned to build relationships with other russian energy firms interested in the development of yuganskneftegas. president putin also suggested that china's national petroleum corporation could play a role in the unit's future after signing a commercial agreement with gazprom to work on joint energy projects. yukos has claimed that the sale of its main asset will lead to the collapse of the company. commentators and yukos itself claim the firm is the target of a government campaign to destroy it because of the political ambitions of its founder, mikhail khodorkovsky.

307,"student 'fee factor' played down

a rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in scotland.

however, lifelong learning minister jim wallace said that this would not result in scottish students missing out. applications from england and wales rose by 17% between january 2005 and the previous year, up 23,600 to 27,700. fears had been expressed that a flood of ""fee refugees"" would try to avoid top-up fees of up to â£3,000 a year being introduced in england. in june last year, mr wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for english students studying in scotland by â£2,000 in an attempt to prevent a cross-border flood, although no figure has yet been agreed. legislation to introduce the top-up fees in england is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all.

the figures were made public on thursday by admissions service ucas. universities scotland, which represents university principals, claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to scottish students being squeezed out. director, david caldwell, said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at english universities, but this was not a major factor. he told bbc radio scotland's good morning scotland programme: ""the reason people are opting for scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality, they offer very attractive courses and scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study.

""they know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top-up fees if they are going to a university in england and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to scotland are so inflated. ""however, it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from england studying here."" mr wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context. he explained that when applications were translated into acceptances, the number was not huge - an additional figure of about 200.

also, the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from wales, where there are no plans for top-up fees, have also risen, by 19%. mr wallace said: ""accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which scottish higher education is held, not just in britain. ""we want to make sure that when students are making their choice, they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to scotland. ""we do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for scottish students to get places at scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option. ""very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students.""
","in june last year, mr wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for english students studying in scotland by â£2,000 in an attempt to prevent a cross-border flood, although no figure has yet been agreed.universities scotland, which represents university principals, claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to scottish students being squeezed out.legislation to introduce the top-up fees in england is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all.""they know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top-up fees if they are going to a university in england and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to scotland are so inflated.a rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in scotland.however, lifelong learning minister jim wallace said that this would not result in scottish students missing out.mr wallace said: ""accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which scottish higher education is held, not just in britain.director, david caldwell, said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at english universities, but this was not a major factor.",politics,511,219

newly-crowned australian open champion marat safin has ruled out any chance of winning wimbledon in the future.

after losing in round one last year, safin said he had ""given up"" on wimbledon and winning his second grand slam title has not changed his mind. ""i'll play, but with no expectations. i feel like i can't waste my time, my energy on that surface,"" he said. ""some people, they cannot play on clay. some people, they cannot play on a hard court. me, i can't play on grass."" however, safin is hopeful that winning the australian open will give him the belief he needs to win more grand slam titles. ""it's a relief for me. two grand slams, it's already something. but with this one i worked really hard for it,"" he said. ""basically, i would love to win a couple more. i think i have a chance if i continue this way.

""if (coach) peter lundgren will stick around with me and wants to work with me for a bit longer, i think i can make it."" the 25-year-old shocked pete sampras in the 2000 us open final to win his first major title but then lost in two australian open finals. safin admitted he had begun to doubt whether he would win another grand slam. ""i didn't expect that (to win the 2000 us open) - it was against sampras, i wasn't the favourite so i had no pressure whatsoever,"" he said.

and after losing the first set 6-1 to lleyton hewitt in sunday's final, safin said he began to doubt himself again. ""i am 25. i'm playing against hewitt. at least you have to have the opportunity to win it, at least have a chance,"" he said. ""it's like you go there and you lose first set 6-1, then you start to think: 'this is not my day. the way i'm playing is ridiculous.'

324,"abortion not a poll issue - blair

tony blair does not believe abortion should be an election issue, arguing it is a matter for individual conscience.

the prime minister's spokesman set out mr blair's view after the top catholic in england and wales backed michael howard's stance on abortions. the tory leader supports a reduction in the legal limit from 24 weeks to 20 and has said current rules are ""tantamount to abortion on demand"". the prime minister has made it clear he has no plans to the change the law.

mr blair's spokesman said: ""the catholic church has a well-known position on this issue and it was one of many issues the cardinal mentioned and therefore it should be seen in that context."" his words came as cardinal cormac murphy o'connor, the archbishop of westminster, backed mr howard's stance and distanced himself from labour. in a statement, he said abortion was a ""very key issue"", saying: ""the policy supported by mr howard is one that we would commend, on the way to a full abandonment of abortion.""

cardinal o'connor claimed labour had ""developed"" the notion that it was the natural party of catholics, but he said: ""we are not going to suggest people support one particular party."" the family planning association says a reduction would particularly affect young women who often seek help later. more than 180,000 women in england and wales had terminations last year, of which fewer than 1% were carried out between 22 and 24 weeks.

in the cosmopolitan interview mr howard said: ""i believe abortion should be available to everyone, but the law should be changed. ""in the past i voted for a restriction to 22 weeks and i would be prepared to go down to 20."" all three main parties say the issue is one for each mp's conscience, rather than one where there is a party-wide policy. mr howard stressed his views were his personal views. shadow home secretary david davis said he understood mr howard had been signalling that a conservative government would allow a commons vote on the issue. mr blair and liberal democrat leader charles kennedy also gave their views during interviews, conducted as part of the magazine's ""high heeled vote"" campaign.

mr blair, who last year denied he planned to join his wife and four children in the catholic faith despite regularly taking communion, said abortion was a ""difficult issue"". ""however much i dislike the idea of abortion, you should not criminalise a woman who, in very difficult circumstances, makes that choice. ""obviously there is a time beyond which you can't have an abortion, and we have no plans to change that although the debate will continue."" mr kennedy said he had previously voted for a 22-week limit but medical advances mean ""i don't know what i would do now"". the roman catholic archbishop of cardiff, the most reverend peter smith, told bbc radio 4's today programme that the church merely wanted people to ""reflect on issues in light of the gospel"" before voting. anne weyman, chief executive of the family planning association, asked: ""what is the benefit to women, or to the potential child, of forcing a woman to have a baby?"" anti-abortion group the pro-life alliance ""congratulated"" mr howard on his new stance, but said it did not go far enough.

despite seeing net profits rise by 44% to $205.4m (â£110m) during october to december, from $142m a year earlier, wall street had expected more. ebay stock fell to $92.9 in after-hours trade, from a $103.05 end on nasdaq. ebay's net revenue for the quarter rose to $935.8m from $648.4m, boosted by growth at its paypal payment service.

85,"what the election should really be about?

a general election is the best chance most pressure groups get to make a real impact on government policy. here is how six leading lobbies plan to make sure their cause is being debated ahead of an expected spring poll.

we've called for the state pension to be increased from â£79.60 to the pensioner credit guarantee level of â£105.45. that's what we're calling for. many pensioners are disadvantaged by the current system. if we've got one in five pensioners below the poverty line, we've got to make it more generous or have these people living in poverty.

we've drawn up a pensioners' manifesto. this will be sent to each of the candidates in the 659 constituencies. they will be asked which of the top five issues, including the pension issue, they would support. once we've got their responses we will publish the results within the constituencies and nationally as well. it's our way of putting the politicians on notice. we are trying to get across the fact that there are 11m voters over 60 in the country, they are more likely to vote than other sections of society and thirdly they are true swing voters. before 1997 most pensioners voted conservative. in 1997 and 2001 they voted labour. but there is no guarantee they will vote for a labour government this time around. they cannot take that vote for granted.

pensions generally will certainly be a big election issue even though the government has postponed the publication of adair turner's full report into the issue. he said the uk had one of the least generous pensions systems in the developed world.

that the government takes seriously the impact of aviation on the environment.

we haven't worked out specific plans but i imagine we will lobby political parties and incumbent mps. various local groups will do that in their particular areas and we will provide a national briefing. we don't have any large demonstrations planned but they can't be ruled out.

it is hard to say whether we will be successful. we have got the issue in the public consciousness to an extent, but it is difficult to say whether an election will raise its importance in the public mind or whether it will be pushed out by big issues like iraq.

repealing the hunting bill.

we are challenging the use of the parliament act 1949 in a high court action. we are hoping to hear in the new year. whichever way the court rules the other side will appeal so we expect it to fall plumb in electioneering time. when the ban comes into force on 18 february we will be going to the european court because no compensation is being paid. so there's a lot of legal territory to go. we are trying to engage with the ministers by demonstrating and talking. whatever intelligence we get we will try to turn up and speak to whoever it is. (rural affairs minister) alun michael has avoided us and cancelled engagements so that makes it difficult. it is not intimidatory - on the whole it is groups of angry housewives. of course there is an element of shouting because people are angry but there is no violence because that does not achieve anything.

it will fall plumb in the run up to the most important general election tony blair will ever face. it's exactly what the prime minister did not want. he wanted the issue off the table until after the election.

people using live animals as targets for sport both here and abroad. the reason for including abroad is because of trophy hunting. it is another sort of form of shooting for sport. the principle is the same whether it's a tiger or a pheasant.

we will widely publicise what's happening in relation to trophy hunting. we will publicise the darker aspects of the target animal industry the uk. we will seek to get pledges from individual mps and would-be mps saying that they are against the use of animals as targets for sports. we would like the support of political parties but i think a general election is very much to do with pledges mps make to their electors. with hunting we had many mps who were happy to say they were against it.

i think what we will get is a very real climbing up the agenda. whether or not we will get a ban i am not sure. but it will mobilise public opinion. everything we do will reduce animal suffering and in time that will lead to a ban.

the issue that we think is the most important for this election is choice. the language of consumerism is very commonplace in government and across the political spectrum. choice as an ideology is beginning to be the privatisation of this decade. it's become an issue in itself but what's really missing from the debate is the consumer's choice in that. choice is not choice at all if all you have to choose from is two failing schools. we have seen so many pensions mis-selling scandals and in the pensions industry there's a maximum of choice but a minimum quality in that. we want choice on the consumer's terms - that means clear and accessible information to operate that choice.

firstly, we have our website. it features our campaigns and changes every day. secondly through our 700,000 members who communicate with us. thirdly through the media and also what we will be doing is holding a pre-election conference. we will invite the opinion formers, mps, journalists and others. the idea is that we open up communications between members of the public and the politicians.

i think we will be successful. it's very much the language being used by the main political parties. politicians on all sides are very sensitive to this issue they want to be seen to be responding to this issue.

fuel duty is a large part of operational costs for road haulage workers. we have been hearing about this proposed increase of 1.92p per litre that gordon brown has been postponing and postponing. tuppence does not sound like a great deal but every year if you operate one vehicle that's an increase of about â£750. if you're running 10 vehicles it's obviously 10 times that.

if fuel duty does rise we will be absolutely horrified. there will be a huge effect throughout the industry and i would not be surprised if you see widespread demonstrations. what it will mean is there will be a number of firms going out of business.

we will continue to do what we have always done we keep the issue in the trade press. regrettably it's one of those stories that it is getting harder to get into the national press. whatever we do, the public don't like lorries - they see us as a complaining minority. but they don't realise that when you see a car on the road it is probably going to work, when you see a lorry it's already at work.

119,"howard dismisses tory tax fears

michael howard has dismissed fears from some conservatives that his plans for â£4bn tax cuts are too modest.

he defended the package, saying it was a plan for the tories' first budget and he hoped to be able to go further. the tories on monday highlighted â£35bn in ""wasteful"" spending they would stop to allow tax cuts, reduced borrowing and more spending on key services. labour and the liberal democrats say the party's sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services. the tory tax plan follows complaints from some of the party's mps that mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin have taken too long to unveil the proposals. now they have promised a figure but have yet to reveal which taxes would be targeted.

tory backbencher edward leigh said the proposals were a step in the right direction but he told the financial times: ""i would come up sooner with much greater tax cuts."" interviewed on bbc radio 2's jeremy vine show, mr howard said: ""it is perfectly true that i am being attacked on one side by people who think we ought to be promising much, much bigger tax cuts and spending cuts.

""on the other side, there are people who say we won't be able to achieve these tax cuts. ""i think we have got it about right."" mr howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes. he added: ""i would like to be able to do more, and over time i am sure we will be able to do more, but at the start, we have got to recognise there is a limit to what we can do in one go, in our first budget. ""i have got to be responsible about this.""

the latest tory plans came as campaigning for the election - widely expected in may - gathered pace. the liberal democrats launched their pre-election platform, with leader charles kennedy saying his party was the ""authentic opposition"", particularly on the iraq war, council tax and university tuition fees. lib dem treasury spokesman vince cable also branded the tory plans as ""fantasy economics"". labour hit back at the tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator alan milburn accusing mr howard of producing a ""fraudulent prospectus"". the party on tuesday challenged the tories to publish the full report from david james, the trouble-shooter they asked to identify possible savings. but the tories are in turn demanding that tony blair spell out which taxes he would raise if he wins the election.

the economic targets set out at the lisbon summit of european union leaders in 2000 were meant to help europe leapfrog its way past the united states to become the world's leading economy by 2010.

but the lisbon targets are about much more than just economic prestige. for many economists and analysts they are about ensuring europe doesn't become a global economic laggard. they are also about ensuring europe can continue to compete as an equal with the growing economic giants of asia, india and china, as well as with the economic might of the united states. that's why there was a tone of urgency in the report, out on wednesday, by the former dutch prime minister wim kok. mr kok was commissioned by the european commission in march this year to assess how far the eu has come towards meeting the lisbon targets, five years on from their inception. his conclusion was simple: too many of the targets will be seriously missed.

lisbon risks becoming a ""synonym for missed objectives and failed promises"", his report said. ""the status quo is not an option.""

at risk in the medium to long run is nothing less than the sustainability of the society europe has built, it said. the report comes at a time when europe's competitive position is waning. the eu's economic growth rate is projected to be 2% this year and 2.4% next. while there has been growth in overall employment rates in europe, productivity lags behind that of the us. but meeting the lisbon targets requires a political commitment that no eu member state has volunteered so far. that has in part been due to the state of the global economy in the past few years.

as mr kok's report noted: ""the ink had scarcely dried on the [lisbon] agreement before the worldwide stock market bubble imploded."" ""the us suffered two years of economic slowdown and recession and the european economy followed suit.""

the circumstances weren't conducive to creating the 20 million new jobs promised by eu leaders in lisbon in 2000. neither were they conducive to getting governments to spend more on research and development, money needed if the eu was to meet its target of becoming a so-called ""knowledge-based economy"". ""the [lisbon] vision is a compelling one, but in order to do it society has to change,"" said paul hofheinz of the lisbon council, a brussels-based citizen action group. ""what you find is that a lot of people have been fighting change. you find trade unions fighting change. but also the employers' associations. ""even though they tell you they're in favour of change, many are actually pushing for less competition, more subsidy and less free market activity.""

but part of the problem was also linked to the original targets set out in lisbon five years ago. targets have a habit of coming back to haunt you and in the lisbon case, they covered too much, according to the wim report. economic growth and job creation were linked to issues ranging from environmental protection to social inclusion, and even safety at sea. the agenda was just too broad and as a result nothing was prioritised.

""lisbon is about everything and thus about nothing,"" the kok report said. ""everybody is responsible and thus no one."" that's why the kok report recommends that the lisbon targets be narrowed down to 14 key indicators, with an emphasis on creating jobs and economic growth. it also recommends that the european commission draw up a league table which ranks countries according to the steps they're taking towards meeting the targets, effectively ""naming, shaming and faming"". ""rhetoric and delivery don't necessarily go hand in hand,"" mr kok said in a press conference alongside the publication of his report. ""we don't have the luxury anymore just to exchange politeness with one another.""

on one point mr kok was very clear: the european union should not try to emulate the us economy. the european economic and social model needs to change, but not so much so that social and environmental issues take a backseat to economic growth. in that sense, the lisbon agenda is sailing into unchartered waters. the kok report tries to do away with a belief that jobs need to be sacrificed at the altar of economic growth. ""it's very ambitious,"" said john palmer, political director at the european policy centre, a brussels-based think-tank. ""this is something that no advanced economy in the world has tried to do. it's going to require quite new and innovative policies."" but some analysts believe that the kok report doesn't come up with the sort of innovative policies and thinking needed to make the lisbon targets a reality. for example, it recommends putting in place policies which encourage women and older people to remain in the workforce. but it doesn't say how companies should be convinced to do this. it will be up to the incoming president of the european commission, jose manuel barroso, to adopt mr kok's recommendations and press them on eu governments. mr barroso has said that the eu's competitiveness will be his top priority. he expects his five-year term in office to be judged on europe's success in meeting the lisbon agenda.

52,"sport betting rules in spotlight

a group of mps and peers has called for a tightening of regulations controlling betting on sport.

the parliamentary group on betting and gaming held a substantial inquiry into betting last year. it followed fears that a massive increase in betting on sport, such as that done using the internet and mobile phones, has led to more cheating. the all-party group recommended 15 ways to protect punters and improve the integrity of sports betting. they include a proposal for raising the maximum jail sentence for gambling cheats above the current two years. lord condon, head of the international cricket council's anti-corruption unit, who originally made the call for longer prison sentences, said the two-year penalty was ""derisory"". ""you could get a bigger sentence for failing to pay your hotel bill criminally than you could for corruption in major sports. ""symbolically, a higher penalty, perhaps as the bill passes through the two houses, might be appropriate.""

the report recommended the governing bodies of sports have a say in the type of bets offered to punters, and for bookmakers to set up ""audit trails"" - something the new betting exchanges already do - to allow suspicious betting patterns to be traced.

lord faulkner of worcester, who chaired the inquiry, said: ""whilst we accept that the greater part of sports betting is neither corrupt nor unfair to punters, the evidence convinces us that the growth of betting exchanges - because of the facility they provide to bet against a result - has increased the potential for corruption. ""it is important that the government works with sporting administrators to review the difficulties faced by governing bodies in convicting the guilty and penalising them appropriately."" the panel's aim was to try to define what constitutes cheating, assess how much might be going on and suggest what the government might do to put it right. as well as the growth of internet and mobile phone betting, there has been the creation of betting exchanges which allow punters to fix odds between themselves. betting exchanges allow punters to back (to win) but also lay (to lose) a horse. this means they can control their odds at winning by placing their money both ways.

1456,"u2's desire to be number one

u2, who have won three prestigious grammy awards for their hit vertigo, are stubbornly clinging to their status as one of the biggest bands in the world.

the most popular groups in the history of rock all have several things in common. the music must be inspired and appeal across generations and be distinctive, if not always groundbreaking. but such success is down to more than music. they have to be compelling performers, charismatic and intelligent enough to make good decisions and keep their feet on the ground. they also have to want it. they have to want to be the biggest band ever and not stop wanting it. the beatles had it, the rolling stones still have it, rem hold onto it and queen were it in a catsuit. and u2 have it in spades, and keep churning it out. their new album, how to dismantle an atomic bomb, comes 28 years after the schoolfriends got together in dublin and 17 years after the joshua tree cemented their place on the all-time rock a-list.

they may have lost some of the edginess and raw, youthful force that propelled them to the top, but they have lost none of the desire or ability to craft songs and albums.

vertigo, the first single from the new album, went straight into the uk singles chart at number one, knocking eminem off the top spot and giving them their 26th top 10 hit. ""the challenge is to be bigger and bolder and better - to make records the whole world will listen to,"" bono recently said. drummer larry mullen jr echoed those sentiments: ""we're very competitive - we want to be on the radio, have big singles. we don't want to be thought of as a veteran band."" the band have done ""everything in their considerable powers"" to ensure they remain the biggest band in the world, according to q magazine editor paul rees.

""this makes them hugely determined and formidable."" he added: ""they are equally determined to push themselves to make music that continues to stand up. ""as such, they've constantly re-invented and challenged themselves. they are, perhaps, alone as the only rock band that has got better with age."" the other key ingredient was the fact they were highly organised, mr rees said. ""they do everything in the right way."" the group were born when mullen put an appeal for bandmates on a high school notice board, attracting fellow pupils paul hewson (bono, vocals), adam clayton (bass), david evans (the edge, guitar) and his brother dick.

dick evans soon dropped out and the four-piece were known as the feedback and the hype before settling on u2.

by 1978, they had won a talent contest and got noticed by a manager, paul mcguinness. ""they were brilliant, but very coarse,"" mcguinness recently said. ""in a way, they were doing exactly what they do now. only badly."" they struggled to attract record company attention, later being described as ""pretty damn average"" and ""strange and eerie"" by scouts who saw them live. they released two ireland-only singles, which topped the national charts in 1979 and 1980, leading to a deal with island and their debut album boy. the stadium-filling, anthemic sound was u2's aim from the start, and their third album, war, saw them make the breakthrough on both sides of the atlantic, going to number one in the uk and 12 in the us. songs like sunday bloody sunday and new year's day brought success and an image as a political and spiritual band - which bono rejected as a cliche.

his stage performances - which included flag-waving, speaker-climbing and drum-throwing - earned him a reputation as an electric performer, and their appearance at 1985's live aid is widely seen as sealing their global stardom.

in 1987, the joshua tree broke sales records and saw the band reach the height of their powers with hits including where the streets have no name, i still haven't found what i'm looking for and with or without you. those songs took the band's epic, atmospheric sound to a simple, powerful and popular pinnacle. the end of the decade marked a crucial point for the band - they had reached the top but still yearned for new challenges and achievements. these came in the form of explorations of different branches of rock and forays into electronic dance music, plus wildly extravagant stage shows, while still trying to retain their mass appeal. the achtung baby album in 1991 was followed by zooropa, pop and their corresponding stadium tours, which featured giant olives, flying cars, live phone calls to the white house and bono's transformation into alter-egos the fly and macphisto. he was also building a parallel reputation - not always to the pleasure of his bandmates - as a campaigner on issues from global debt to aids. before the release of how to dismantle an atomic bomb, they had sold 125 million albums around the world. but they still want more.

940,"net regulation 'still possible'

the blurring of boundaries between tv and the internet raises questions of regulation, watchdog ofcom has said.

content on tv and the internet is set to move closer this year as tv-quality video online becomes a norm. at a debate in westminster, the net industry considered the options. lord currie, chairman of super-regulator ofcom, told the panel that protecting audiences would always have to be a primary concern for the watchdog. despite having no remit for the regulation of net content, disquiet has increased among internet service providers as speeches made by ofcom in recent months hinted that regulation might be an option. at the debate, organised by the internet service providers' association (ispa), lord currie did not rule out the possibility of regulation.

""the challenge will arise when boundaries between tv and the internet truly blur and then there is a balance to be struck between protecting consumers and allowing them to assess the risks themselves,"" he said. adopting the rules that currently exist to regulate tv content or self-regulation, which is currently the practice of the net industry, will be up for discussion.

some studies suggest that as many as eight million households in the uk could have adopted broadband by the end of 2005, and the technology opens the door to tv content delivered over the net. more and more internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content on the web. bt has already set up an entertainment division to create and distribute content that could come from sources such as bskyb, itv and the bbc. head of the division, andrew burke, spoke about the possibility of creating content for all platforms. ""how risque can i be in this new age? with celebrity chefs serving up more expletives than hot dinners, surely i can push it to the limit,"" he said.

in fact, he said, if content has been requested by consumers and they have gone to lengths to download it, then maybe it should be entirely regulation free. internet service providers have long claimed no responsibility for the content they carry on their servers since the law commission dubbed them ""mere conduits"" back in 2002. this defence does not apply if they have actual knowledge of illegal content and have failed to remove it. the level of responsibility they have has been tested in several high-profile legal cases. richard ayers, portal director at tiscali, said there was little point trying to regulate the internet because it would be impossible. huge changes are afoot in 2005, he predicted, as companies such as the bbc offer tv content over the net. the bbc's planned interactive media player which will give surfers the chance to download programmes such as eastenders and top gear will make net tv mainstream and raise a whole new set of questions, he said.

one of these will be about the vast sums of money involved in maintaining the network to supply such a huge quantity of data and could herald a new digital licence fee, said mr ayers. as inappropriate net content, most obviously pornography viewed by children, continues to dominate the headlines, internet regulation remains a political issue said mp richard allan, liberal democrat spokesman on it. mr allan thinks that the answer could lie somewhere between the cries of ""impossible to regulate"" and ""just apply offline laws online"". in fact, instead of seeing regulation brought online, the future could bring an end to regulation as we know it for all tv content. after lord currie departed, the panel agreed that this could be a reality and that for the internet people power is likely to reign. ""if content is on-demand, consumers have pulled it up rather than had pushed to them, then it is the consumers' choice to watch it. there is no watershed on the net,"" said mr burke.

9,"tories unveil quango blitz plans

plans to abolish 162 quangos have been unveiled by the conservatives as part of their effort to show how government red tape can be cut.

six government units would also be scrapped under proposals which the tories say would save more than â£4.3bn. among the targets are strategic health authorities and the new fair access regulator for universities. tory frontbencher john redwood said britain needed a slimmer government and lower taxes to be competitive.

the plans would abolish regional assemblies and other regional bodies, such as boards tackling industrial development and housing. their powers would be returned to elected local councils or national government. the tories say the strategic health authorities are not needed as it is better that local people, rather than officials, run hospitals and surgeries.

announcing the plans, mr redwood said: ""mr blair has forgotten the interests of taxpayers, and has broken the pledges he made. ""far from improving public services, spending taxpayers' money on quangos has led only to more bureaucrats, more regulation and higher taxes."" his party leader, michael howard, argued a change in direction was needed to get a grip on spending. ""labour are creating two britains: the britain of the forgotten majority and bureaucratic britain,"" he said. ""in the real world, people are working harder just to stand still. they've seen their pensions knocked for six. ""they're being squeezed by extra taxes. the forgotten majority are paying the price of bureaucratic britain.""

the government has announced plans to cut 100,000 civil servants as part of its efficiency drive. but chief secretary to the treasury paul boateng attacked the tory plans. ""the conservatives are committed to cutting labour's public spending plans by a massive â£35 billion,"" he said. ""cuts on this scale cannot be found from cutting 'bureaucracy' but would require massive cuts to front-line public services such as schools, hospitals and the police."" the liberal democrats have said they would cut the number of whitehall departments to make sure money reaches frontline services.

uk retail sales fell in december, failing to meet expectations and making it by some counts the worst christmas since 1981.

retail sales dropped by 1% on the month in december, after a 0.6% rise in november, the office for national statistics (ons) said. the ons revised the annual 2004 rate of growth down from the 5.9% estimated in november to 3.2%. a number of retailers have already reported poor figures for december. clothing retailers and non-specialist stores were the worst hit with only internet retailers showing any significant growth, according to the ons.

the last time retailers endured a tougher christmas was 23 years previously, when sales plunged 1.7%.

the ons echoed an earlier caution from bank of england governor mervyn king not to read too much into the poor december figures. some analysts put a positive gloss on the figures, pointing out that the non-seasonally-adjusted figures showed a performance comparable with 2003. the november-december jump last year was roughly comparable with recent averages, although some way below the serious booms seen in the 1990s. and figures for retail volume outperformed measures of actual spending, an indication that consumers are looking for bargains, and retailers are cutting their prices.

however, reports from some high street retailers highlight the weakness of the sector. morrisons, woolworths, house of fraser, marks & spencer and big food all said that the festive period was disappointing.

and a british retail consortium survey found that christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years. yet, other retailers - including hmv, monsoon, jessops, body shop and tesco - reported that festive sales were well up on last year. investec chief economist philip shaw said he did not expect the poor retail figures to have any immediate effect on interest rates. ""the retail sales figures are very weak, but as bank of england governor mervyn king indicated last night, you don't really get an accurate impression of christmas trading until about easter,"" said mr shaw. ""our view is the bank of england will keep its powder dry and wait to see the big picture.""

2143,"senior fannie mae bosses resign

the two most senior executives at us mortgage giant fannie mae have resigned after accounting irregularities were uncovered at the company.

chief executive franklin raines, a former senior official in the clinton administration, and chief financial officer tim howard have left the firm. fannie mae was criticised by financial regulators and could have to restate its earnings by up to $9bn (â£4.6bn). it is america's second largest financial institution.

recent investigations have exposed extensive accounting errors at fannie mae, which supplies funds to america's $8 trillion mortgage market. last week, the firm was admonished by the securities and exchange commission which said it had made major errors in its financial reporting.

the financial regulator said fannie mae would have to raise substantial new capital to restore its balance sheet. analysts said the sec's criticism made it impossible for fannie mae's senior executives to remain. mr raines, head of the office of management and budget under president clinton, has taken early retirement while mr howard has also stepped down, the company said on tuesday. kpmg, fannie mae's independent auditor, will also be replaced. ""by my early retirement, i have held myself accountable,"" mr raines said in a statement.

fannie mae was found to have violated accounting rules relating to derivatives - financial instruments used to hedge against fluctuations in interest rates - and some pre-paid loans. as a result, it could be forced to restate $9bn in earnings over the past four years, effectively wiping out a third of the company's profits since 2001. although not making loans directly to buyers, fannie mae is the largest single player in the mortgage market, underwriting half of all us house purchases. the firm operates under charter from the us congress. it has faced stinging criticism from congressional leaders who held hearings into its finances earlier this year and from government regulator, the office of federal housing enterprise oversight (ofheo). ""we are encouraged that the board's announcement signals a new culture and a new direction for fannie mae,"" armando falcon, ofheo director said. the problems afflicting fannie mae are just the latest to hit the us mortgage industry. freddie mac, the country's other largest mortgage firm, was forced to restate its earnings by $4.4bn last year and pay a $125m fine after an investigation of its books.

607,"2004: an irish athletics year

2004 won't be remembered as one of irish athletics' great years.

the year began with that optimism which invariably and unaccountably, seems to herald an upcoming olympiad. but come late august, a few hot days in the magnificent stadium in athens told us of the true strength of irish athletics - or to be more accurate, the lack of it. sonia o'sullivan's olympic farewell apart, there was little to stir the emotions of irish athletics watchers. but after the disastrous build-up to the games, we shouldn't have been surprised. at the start of the year, an o'sullivan had been earmarked as ireland's best medal prospect but as it turned out, walker gillian never even made it to the start line because of injury. less than a week before the olympics, the sport was rocked by news that 10,000m hope cathal lombard had tested for the banned substance epo. lombard's shattering of mark carroll's national 10,000m record in april had already set tongues wagging but even the most cynical of observers, were surprised when he was rumbled after an irish sports council sting operation. the corkman quickly held his hands up in admission and was promptly handed a two-year ban from the sport.

back at pre-olympic ranch in greece, it must have seemed that things couldn't have got any worse but they very nearly did with walker jamie costin lucky to escape with his life after being involved in a car crash near athens. once the track and field action began in athens, a familiar pattern of underachievement emerged although alistair cragg's performance in being the only athlete from a european nation to qualify for the 5,000m final did offer hope for the future. our beloved sonia scraped into the women's 5k final as a fastest loser and for a couple of days, the country attempted to delude itself into believing that she might be in the medal shake-up. as it happened, she went out the back door early in the final although there was nothing undignified about the way that she insisted on finishing the race over a minute behind winner meseret defar. it later transpired that sonia had been suffering from a stomach bug in the 48 hours before the final although typically, the cobhwoman played down the effects of the illness. amazingly, she was back in action a couple of weeks later when beating a world-class field at the flora lite 5k road race in london and while her major championship days may be over, it's unlikely that we have seen the last of her in competition. at least sonia managed to make it to athens. at the start of the year, several northern ireland athletes had genuine hopes of qualifying for the games but come august, an out-of-form and injured paul brizzel was the lone standard bearer for the province. the ballymena man gave it a lash but his achilles problem, and a bad lane draw, meant a time of 21.00 and an early exit.

james mcilroy, gareth turnbull, zoe brown and paul mckee all had to be content with watching the athens action on their television screens. 800m hope mcilroy never got near his best during the summer and a fourth place in the british trials effectively ended his hopes of making the plane. the injury-plagued turnbull gamely travelled round europe in search of the 1500m qualifying mark but 3:39 was the best he could achieve, after missing several months training during the previous winter. a lingering hamstring probem and a virus wrecked mckee's athens ambitions and both he and turnbull deserve a slice of better fortune in 2005. pole vaulter brown had hoped for a vote of confidence from the british selectors after she had achieved the athens b standard but the call never came. as the summer ended, stalwarts catherina mckiernan and dermot donnelly hung up their competitive spikes. mckiernan had to candidly acknowledge that time had crept up on her after several injury-ravaged years. donnelly and his annadale striders team-mates later suffered tragedy when their friend and clubman andy campbell was found dead at his home on 18 december. a large turnout of athletics-loving folk turned out in west belfast to offer their respects to the campbell family and andy's many friends. as only death can, it put the year's athletics happenings in a sharp perspective.

britain's jason gardener shook off an upset stomach to win the 60m at sunday's leipzig international meeting.

2115,"turkey turns on the economic charm

three years after a gruelling economic crisis, turkey has dressed its economy to impress.

as part of a charm offensive - ahead of 17 december, when the european union will decide whether to start entry talks - turkey's economic leaders have been banging the drum to draw attention to recent achievements. the economy is growing fast, they insist. education levels among its young and large population are rising. unemployment levels, in percentage terms, are heading fast towards single digits. inflation is under control. a new law to govern its turbulent banking system is on the cards. the tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to $21bn (â£10.8bn) in three years.

moreover, government spending is set to be frozen and a burdensome social security deficit is being tackled. income and corporate taxes will be cut next year in order to attract $15bn of foreign investment over the next three years. a loan restructuring deal with the international monetary fund (imf) is pretty much in the can. and following recent macroeconomic restructuring efforts, its currency is floating freely and its central bank is independent.

the point of all this has been to convince europe's decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the eu, allowing turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits.

""the cake will be bigger for everybody,"" said deputy prime minister abdullatif sener earlier this month. ""turkey will not be a burden for the eu budget."" if admitted into the eu, turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros ($8bn; â£6bn) to its budget by 2014, according to a recent impact study by the country's state planning organisation. as turkey's gross domestic output (gdp) is set to grow by 6% per year on average, its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020. turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in ""old europe"" once its population comes of age. by 2014, one in four turks - or about 18 million people - will be aged 14 or less. ""a literate and qualified turkish population,"" insisted mr sener, ""will make a positive impact on the eu.""

this runs contrary to the popular view that turkey is getting ready to dig deep into eu taxpayers' wallets. however, turkey's assertions are confirmed by brussels' own impact studies, which indeed say that turkish membership would be good news for the eu economy. but only over time. costs are projected to be vast during the early years of turkey's membership, with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16.5bn euros and, according to some predictions, balloon to 33.5bn euros. this would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid, though such payments should decline as the country's farm sector, which currently employs one in three turks, would employ just one in five by 2020.

such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by turkey's government would never be delivered, say those who feel the turkish project should be shunned.

some fear that rather than providing an educated, sophisticated labour force for europe at large, the people who will leave turkey to seek work abroad will be poor, uneducated - and plentiful. more recently, less palatable concerns - at least in liberal european circles - have been voiced, with senior eu or member state officials talking darkly of a ""river of islam"", an ""oriental"" culture and a threat to europe's ""cultural richness"". of course, many opponents are politically motivated - their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the country's muslim traditions to well-documented concerns about the government's human rights record. yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of hand.

critics insist that much of the optimism about turkey's economic roadmap has been over-egged - an argument amplified by a 134% rise in the country's current account deficit to $10.7bn during the first 10 months of this year.

the country's massive debt - which includes $23bn owed to the imf and billions borrowed via the international bond markets - also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the eu. ""in the new member states of the european union, gross public debt is typically about 40% of gross domestic product,"" says reza moghadam, assistant director of the imf's european department. ""at about 80% of gdp, turkey's gross debt is double that figure."" turkey's debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the country's devastating recession. ""there is no question that although turkey is doing much better than in the past, it remains quite vulnerable,"" says michael deppler, director of the imf's european department. ""its debt is far too high for an emerging economy."" a key factor for eu decision makers should be whether or not turkey has met its economic criteria. but economics is not a science. and although the state of turkey's economy is important, as is its pace of reform, the final decision on 17 december will be taken by politicians who will, of course, be guided by their political instincts.

2009,"soros group warns of kazakh close

the open society institute (osi), financed by billionaire george soros, has accused kazakhstan officials of trying to close down its local office.

a demand for unpaid taxes and fines of $600,000 (â£425,000) is politically motivated, the osi claimed, adding that it paid the money in october. the organisation has found itself in trouble after being accused of helping to topple georgia's former president. it denies having any role, but offices have had to close across the region.

the osi shut its office in moscow last year and has withdrawn from uzbekistan and belarus. in the ukraine earlier this year, mr soros - who took on the bank of england in the 1990s - and won, was pelted by protestors. ""this legal prosecution can be considered an attempt by the government to force soros foundation-kazakhstan to cease its activities in kazakhstan and shut its doors for kazakh citizens and organisations,"" the osi said.

the osi aims to promote democratic and open, market-based societies. since the break up of the soviet union in 1991, kazakhstan has been dominated by its president nursultan abish-uly nazarbayev. he has powers for life, while insulting the president and officials has been made a criminal offence. the government controls the printing presses and most radio and tv transmission facilities. it operates the country's national radio and tv networks. recent elections were criticised as flawed and the opposition claimed there was widespread vote rigging. supporters, however, say he brings much needed stability to a region where islamic militancy is on the rise. they also credit him with promoting inter-ethnic accord and pushing through harsh reforms.

89,"kennedy questions trust of blair

lib dem leader charles kennedy has said voters now have a ""fundamental lack of trust"" of tony blair as prime minister.

he said backing his party was not a wasted vote, adding that with the lib dems ""what you see is what you get"". he made his comments at the start of a day of appearances on channel five in a session on the wright stuff programme. questions from callers, a studio audience and the show's presenter covered lib dem tax plans, anti-terror laws and immigration.

mr kennedy said during his nearly 22 years in parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of british politics. ""1983 was when i was first elected as an mp - so tony blair, michael howard and myself were all class of '83 - and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition,"" he said. ""we don't actually hear the argument any longer: 'lib dems, good people, reasonable ideas but only if we thought they could win around here - it's a wasted vote'. ""you don't hear that because the evidence of people's senses demonstrates that it isn't a wasted vote."" but he said mr blair had lost the trust of the british people. ""there is a fundamental lack of trust in tony blair as prime minister and in his government,"" he said.

""what we've got to do as a party - what i've got to do as a leader of this party - is to convey to people that what you see is what you get."" mr kennedy also used his tv appearance to defend his party's plans to increase income tax to 50% for those earning more than â£100,000, saying it would apply to just 1% of the population. he said the extra revenue would allow his party to get rid of tuition and top-up fees, introduce free personal care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local income tax. mr blair has already spent a day with five and michael howard is booked for a similar session.

1052,"rich pickings for hi-tech thieves

viruses, trojans and other malicious programs sent on to the net to catch you out are undergoing a subtle change.

the shift is happening as tech savvy criminals turn to technology to help them con people out of cash, steal valuable data or take over home pcs. viruses written to make headlines by infecting millions are getting rarer. instead programs are now crafted for directly criminal ends and firms are tightening up networks with defences to combat the new wave of malicious code.

the growing criminal use of malware has meant the end of the neat categorisation of different sorts of viruses and malicious programs. before now it has been broadly possible to name and categorise viruses by the method they use to spread and how they infect machines. but many of the viruses written by criminals roll lots of technical tricks together into one nasty package.

""you cannot put them in to the neat little box that you used to,"" said pete simpson, head of the threat laboratory at security firm clearswift. now viruses are just as likely to spread by themselves like worms, or to exploit loopholes in browsers or hide in e-mail message attachments. ""it's about outright criminality now,"" said mr simpson, explaining why this change has come about. he said many of the criminal programs came from eastern europe where cash-rich organised gangs can find a ready supply of technical experts that will crank out code to order. former virus writer marek strihavka, aka benny from the 29a virus writing group, recently quit the malware scene partly because it was being taken over by spyware writers, phishing gangs, and spammers who are more interested in money rather than the technology. no longer do virus writers produce programs to show off their technical prowess to rivals in the underground world of malware authors. not least, said paul king, principal security consultant at cisco, because the defences against such attacks are so common. ""in many ways the least likely way to do it is e-mail because most of us have got anti-virus and firewalls now,"" he said. few of the malicious programs written by hi-tech thieves are cleverly written, many are much more pragmatic and use tried and tested techniques to infect machines or to trick users into installing a program or handing over important data. ""if you think of criminals they do not do clever,"" said mr king, ""they just do what works.""

as the tactics used by malicious programs change, said mr king, so many firms were changing the way they defend themselves. now many scan machines that connect to the corporate networks to ensure they have not been compromised while off the core network.

many will not let a machine connect and a worker get on with their job before the latest patches and settings have been uploaded. as well as using different tactics, criminals also use technology for reasons that are much more transparent. ""the main motivation now is money,"" said gary stowell, spokesman for st bernard software. mr stowell said organised crime gangs were turning to computer crime because the risks of being caught were low and the rates of return were very high. with almost any phishing or spyware attack, criminals are guaranteed to catch some people out and have the contacts to exploit what they recover. so-called spyware was proving very popular with criminals because it allowed them to take over machines for their own ends, to steal key data from users or to hijack web browsing sessions to point people at particular sites. in some cases spyware was being written that searched for rival malicious programs on pcs it infects and then trying to erase them so it has sole ownership of that machine.

1343,"dance music not dead says fatboy

dj norman cook - aka fatboy slim - has said that dance music is not dead, but has admitted it is currently going through a ""fallow patch"".

the commercial failure of the latest albums by britain's two biggest dance acts - fatboy slim's palookaville and the prodigy's always outnumbered never outgunned - has been coupled with the closure of many ""superclubs,"" and the folding of three dance music magazines. last month the brit awards announced they would no longer be awarding a best dance act prize, with the brits committee announcing that ""dance music is no longer where it's happening in music."" these developments lead some to suggest that dance was finished as a popular music genre. cook acknowledged that much change in the dance world in the four years since his last album, halfway between the gutter and the stars, but he stressed this did not mean the dance scene was permanently over. ""every week when i was making the album, i was reading articles about the demise of dance music - and obviously that affects you somewhat,"" he told bbc world service's the ticket programme. ""i personally don't believe it's either dead or going to die, but it's going through a bit of a fallow patch. ""so i think, consciously or subconsciously, reading every week that dance music was dead i would think 'right, scrub that track then'.""

although his album sales in the uk are down - palookaville stayed in the uk top 75 for just three weeks - cook has achieved recent global success with his beach parties. and event on brighton sea front in 2002 attracted 250,000, people, while a later one in rio achieved a crowd of 360,000. the dvd of the rio set was the biggest seller of that year.

""with a crowd that big, if the weather's nice, the atmosphere before i even go is so good that about halfway through the first record i think 'i've got them',"" cook said. ""i'm always really really nervous before the big ones - they had to give me valium before rio, because two hours before i was literally just pacing the floor. ""for some reason, especially now i've got a reputation for it, the atmosphere and the joie de vivre that's already going on means all i have to do is play 'up' records."" he promised more such parties in more locations around the world - despite problems after the brighton event, which ended in chaos with many revellers finding themselves stranded as transport ground to a halt. one man also died of a heart attack, and a woman fell to her death during the free party. ""we're having to widen our horizons from just beaches, because there's landlocked countries that want to get involved,"" cook said. ""we're doing rio at the carnival, at the maracana, and sao paolo - our new gig is famous football stadiums.""

the dj admitted, however, that his massive worldwide success had a downside, with intense media interest in his personal life. in particular, he said he had struggled to cope with tabloid intrusion during the temporary break-up of his marriage to radio one presenter zoe ball, after she was linked with dj dan peppe.

""the tabloid thing has been difficult at times,"" cook said. ""especially the me-and-zoe-gate - it's quite scary."" he said that he had been ""determined"" that what had happened with ball did not affect the album. ""at first i was doing deliberately jolly tunes so that people wouldn't think i was depressed,"" he explained. ""then i thought, 'that's not right'."" and he highlighted a bizarre coincidence - that one song written before they split had turned out to have a great deal more meaning than intended. ""i said to zoe, 'i did this track called my masochistic baby went and left me, do you mind if it's on the album?'"" he recalled. ""she said, 'yeah, it's hilarious, because your masochistic baby did leave you'."" cook also added that he had some ways of coping with the intense paparazzi pressure, which accumulates at the end of the private road he lives on - where paul mccartney is a neighbour. ""it's almost like prisoners rattling the bars with their mugs,"" cook explained. ""if there's a pap at the end of the road, everyone knocks on each other's doors - paul comes round, and we warn him, because we don't know who they're after.""

1186,"who do you think you are?

the real danger is not what happens to your data as it crosses the net, argues analyst bill thompson. it is what happens when it arrives at the other end.

the financial services authority has warned banks and other financial institutions that members of criminal gangs may be applying for jobs which give them access to confidential customer data. the fear is not that they will steal money from our bank accounts but that they will instead steal something far more valuable in our digital society - our identities. armed with the personal details that a bank holds, plus a fake letter or two, it is apparently easy to get a loan, open a bank account with an overdraft or get a credit card in someone else's name. and it is then a simple matter to move the money into another account and leave the unwitting victim to sort out the mess when statements and demands for payment start arriving. identity theft is an increasingly significant economic crime, and we are all becoming more aware of the dangers of leaving bills, receipts and bank statements unshredded in our rubbish.

but, however careful you may be, if the organisations you trust with your personal data, bank accounts and credit cards are not able to look after their databases properly then you are in trouble. it is surprising that it has taken the gangs so long to realise that a well-placed insider is by far the simplest way to break the security of a computer system. in fact, i suspect that the fsa is probably very late to this particular party and that this sort of thing has been going on for rather a long time. has anyone checked bob cratchit's family links to the criminal underworld, i wonder? and it is hardly likely to be only banks that are being targeted. health authorities, government agencies and of course the big e-commerce sites like amazon must also offer rich pickings for the fraudsters. the good news is that better auditing is likely to catch out those who access account details that they are not supposed to. and as we all become aware of the danger of identity theft and look more carefully for unexpected transactions on our statements, banks should have good enough records and logs to trace the people who might have accessed the account details. fortunately there are now ways to keep bank systems more secure from the sort of data theft that involves taking a portable hard drive or flash memory card into the office, plugging it into a usb slot and sucking down customer files.

companies like securewave, for example, can restrict the use of usb ports just to authorised devices or even to an individual's personal memory card. these solutions are not perfect, but it does not feel like a wave of fraud is about to wash away the entire financial system. however the warning does highlight one of the major issues with e-commerce and online trading - the security or otherwise of the servers and other systems that make up the 'back office'. it has been clear for years that the real danger in paying for goods online with a credit card is not that the number will be intercepted in transit but that the shop you are dealing with will be hacked.

in fact i do not know of a single case where an e-mail containing payment details has led to card fraud.

there are simply too many e-mails passing over the net for interception to be a sensible tool for anyone out to commit fraud. cd universe, powergen and many other companies have left their databases open and suffered the consequences. and just last week the online bank cahoot admitted that its customer account details could be read by anyone who could guess a login name. whether it is external hackers breaking in because of poor system security or internal staff abusing the access they get as part of their job, the issue is the same: how do we make sure that our personal data is not abused? any organisation that processes personal data is, of course, bound by the data protection act and must take proper care of it. unauthorised disclosure is not allowed, but the penalties are small and the process of prosecuting under the act so convoluted as to be worthless in practice. this is not something we can just leave it to the market. the consequences of having one's identity stolen are too serious, and markets respond too slowly. after all, i bank with cahoot but it would be so much hassle to move my accounts that i did not even consider it when i heard about their security problems. i doubt many others have closed their accounts, especially when there is little guarantee that other banks are not going to make the same sort of mistake in future. the two options would seem to be more stringent data protection law, so that companies really feel the pressure to improve their internal processes, or a wave of civil lawsuits against financial institutions with sloppy practices whose customers suffer from identity theft. i have never felt comfortable with the us practice of suing everything that moves, partly because it seems to make lawyers richer than their clients, so i know which i'd prefer.

""the fsa should change, and change now"" said mr prettejohn, who wants it to move from ""disclosure on request"" to mandatory disclosure. the call came in a speech on improving the london insurance market.

""the fsa should not bide their time and 'wait and see'. they should seize the moment,"" mr prettejohn, lloyd's chief executive said. the fsa took over regulation of the general insurance sector in january, but it sidestepped calls to require brokers to disclose the commissions they earn from insurers to their clients. last week, the city watchdog gave brokers and insurers guidance on managing conflicts of interest. brokers must give information on their commissions if, and only if, their customers request it, the fsa said.

in the us, lack of transparency about brokers' commissions has led to problems. the world's biggest insurance broker marsh & mclennan said last week it would pay $850m to settle charges, raised by new york attorney general eliot spitzer in october, that it sought to rig bids in conjunction with insurers. the probe centred around so-called contingent commissions, whereby brokers were rewarded according to how much business they brought to an insurer, an arrangement that did not always benefit brokers' customers. all of the insurance business written in the lloyd's market is placed via brokers.

604,"henman overcomes rival rusedski

tim henman saved a match point before fighting back to defeat british rival greg rusedski 4-6 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 at the dubai tennis championships on tuesday.

world number 46 rusedski broke in the ninth game to take a tight opening set. rusedski had match point at 6-5 in the second set tie-break after henman double-faulted, but missed his chance and henman rallied to clinch the set. the british number one then showed his superior strength to take the decider and earn his sixth win over rusedski. serve was held by both players with few alarms until the seventh game of the final set, when rusedski's wild volley gave henman a vital break. a furious rusedski slammed his racket onto the ground in disgust and was warned by the umpire.

henman, seeded three, then held his serve comfortably thanks to four serve-and-volley winners to take a clear 5-3 lead. rusedski won his service game but henman took the first of his three match points with a service winner to secure his place in the second round at dubai for the first time in three years. it was the first match between the pair for three years - henman last lost to rusedski six years ago - and lasted two hours and 40 minutes. the pair are now likely to only face each other on court as rivals - rather than as team-mates - after henman decided to retire from davis cup tennis leaving rusedski to lead the team out against israel on 4-6 march. henman, who now faces russian igor andreev in the last 16, admitted afterwards it was difficult coming up against his compatriot on a fast surface. ""you just take it point by point when you're fighting to stay in the match,"" he said. ""i had to keep playing aggressively and competing to get a chance. ""i now have to recover in time for the next match because the body doesn't recover as quick as it used to, especially after two hours and 40 minutes.""

806,"iaaf will contest greek decision

the international association of athletics federations will appeal against the acquittal of greek athletes kostas kenteris and katerina thanou.

the high-profile duo were cleared of doping offences by the greek athletics federation (segas) last month. now the iaaf will lodge an appeal with the court of arbitration for sport (cas) and has suspended both athletes. an iaaf statement said: ""the doping review board concluded that the decision is erroneous."" the statement continued: ""both athletes' cases will be refered to arbitration before the cas. the decision in both cases will be final and binding.""

segas said the iaaf appeal was ""expected"" and ""understandable."" ""now we are going to await the final result, which we cannot prejudge,"" said segas chairman vassilis sevastis. kenteris, who won olympic 200m gold at the 2000 olympics, and thanou were suspended by the iaaf last december after failing to take routine drugs tests before the athens games. however, the independent tribunal overturned those bans, clearing the sprinters of avoiding tests in tel aviv, chicago and athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics.

kenteris' lawyer gregory ioannidis described the iaaf's decision as ""not unexpected"" but told bbc sport he did not expect the organisation to take action so quickly. ""the iaaf's timing is extremely surprising and it creates concerns and questions,"" said ioannidis. ""the iaaf has not yet received the complete file of proceedings which include statements, testimonies, the closing speeches of defence counsel... and nine audio tapes.

""we have the evidence and it is time the world discovered the truth."" kenteris and thanou dramatically withdrew from last summer's olympics after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on 12 august. the pair then spent four days in a hospital, claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. it was the international olympic committee who demanded the iaaf investigate the affair. thanou and kenteris still face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident

australian tennis coach tony roche has turned down an approach from roger federer to be the world number one's new full-time coach, say reports.

he also coached former number one ivan lendl and pat rafter to grand slam victories and has worked with australia's lleyton hewitt. some reports claim federer initially wanted andre agassi's australian coach darren cahill, before agassi confirmed he would play on in 2005. federer was named swiss sportsman of the year on saturday, to add to the bbc overseas sportsman and european sports journalists association awards he has already won.

349,"nhs waiting time target is cut

hospital waiting times for patients in wales are to be cut, but not to the same extent as those in england.

welsh health minister jane hutt said no patient would wait more than 12 months for an outpatient appointment by march 2006, against a current target of 18 months. but she said the target for an inpatient appointment would remain at 12 months for march 2006. the announcement came as new monthly waiting figures showed a drop. this current inpatient target was set when the assembly government extended its second offer guarantee scheme, which gives patients the option of having their treatment outside wales.

details about funding to resource the new targets are expected in the new year. in england, the current target for inpatients - seeing a consultant to having an operation - is six months. dr richard lewis, welsh secretary of the british medical association (bma), welcomed the new targets ""to make further and faster progress on waiting lists"". ""however, much remains to be done on waiting lists and waiting times because wales still lags a long way behind england,"" he said. ""capacity must be built into the system with sustained investment to ensure that welsh patients don't receive a worse service than patients over the border."" health analyst tony beddow, from the welsh institute for health and social care, called the new targets ""reasonably impressive"".

on wednesday, ms hutt also announced â£264m for health services will be spent reducing waiting times, improving key areas and modernising staff pay structures in wales.

ms hutt said major achievements had been made in cutting ""unacceptably long waits for treatment over the past year"". ""we are turning the corner on long waits in wales. now we need to see those reductions in long waiters being improved again,"" she said. she added the targets intended to ensure no-one waits more than a year for treatment or to see a consultant. ""but let us not forget two thirds of those waiting for treatment now are waiting less than six months, and these targets affect the small minority of patients in wales that are waiting far too long."" rhodri glyn thomas, plaid cymru health spokesman said: ""it's exactly the same target she set in 1999, with the qualification that it's dependent on a second offer. it's a failed target, from a failed minister..with a failed policy."" for the welsh liberal democrats, kirsty williams called the new target ""hugely unambitious"". ""it leaves patients in wales still waiting two years before they're treated."" conservative health spokesman jonathan morgan said: ""we're spending more money but waiting lists have gone through the roof. ""the audit commission has said that the money is not being spent efficiently or effectively, and that's quite a criticism."" meanwhile, the latest monthly waiting list figures showed the total number of people waiting more than 18 months as an inpatient in wales has fallen by 9.8%. statistics to the end of november showed a decline since october from 785 to 708. the number waiting over 12 months also fell from 7,613 to 6,630, or 12.9%. ms hutt said they were ""excellent figures"". there are 305,775 people on a waiting list of some kind, down from 311,764 last month.

the bank of america has revealed it has lost computer tapes containing account details of more than one million customers who are us federal employees.

several members of the us senate are among those affected, who could now be vulnerable to identity theft. senate sources say the missing tapes may have been stolen from a plane by baggage handlers. the bank gave no details of how the records disappeared, but said they had probably not been misused. customers' accounts were being monitoring and account holders would be notified if any ""unusual activity"" was detected, bank officials said.

bank of america said the tapes went missing in december while being shipped to a back-up data centre. ""we, with federal law authorities, have done a very robust, thorough investigation on this and neither we nor they would make the statement lightly that we believe those tapes to be lost,"" alexandra tower, a spokeswoman for the north carolina-based bank, told time magazine. but although there was no evidence of criminal activity, the bank said, the secret service - a federal agency whose brief includes investigations of serious financial crime - is said to be looking into the loss. new york senator charles schumer said he was told by the senate rules committee that the tapes were probably stolen from a commercial plane. ""whether it is identity theft, terrorism, or other theft, in this new complicated world baggage handlers should have background checks and more care should be taken for who is hired for these increasingly sensitive positions,"" the democrat senator said. details of his vermont colleague pat leahy's credit card account are among those missing, senator leahy's spokeswoman tracy schmaler said. about 900,000 military and civilian staff at the defence department are among the 1.2 million affected, according to a pentagon spokesman.

213,"kilroy launches 'veritas' party

ex-bbc chat show host and east midlands mep robert kilroy-silk has said he wants to ""change the face of british politics"" as he launched his new party.

mr kilroy-silk, who recently quit the uk independence party,said ""our country"" was being ""stolen from us"" by mass immigration. he told a london news conference that veritas - latin for ""truth"" - would avoid the old parties' ""lies and spin"". ukip leader roger knapman says he was glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk.

mr kilroy-silk promised a ""firm but fair"" policy on immigration and said they hoped to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election. he said veritas would also announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks. and he announced the party would be holding a leadership election. on thursday he is due to announce which constituency he will run in at the next general election - that will come amid speculation he has his sights set on defence secretary geoff hoon's ashfield seat. he was joined in the new venture by one of ukip's two london assembly members, damien hockney who is now veritas' deputy leader. ukip's chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left.

mr kilroy-silk announced his decision to quit ukip at a public meeting in hinckley, leicestershire last week. it came after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had ""gone awol"" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june's european elections. ""while ukip has turned its back on the british people, i shall not,"" he said. ""i will be standing at the next general election. i shall be leading a vigorous campaign for the causes i believe in. ""and, unlike the old parties, we shall be honest, open and straight.""

mr hockney also left ukip saying mr kilroy-silk would ""deliver better"" as the leader of a eurosceptic party. a spokesman for ukip called on mr hockney to quit the london assembly. the party asserts that mr hockney ""has a moral obligation, if not a legal one"" to stand down. its leader, roger knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk. ""he has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [european] election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',"" he said. ukip officials also argue mr kilroy-silk has not been ""straightforward"" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.

this is just what the europhiles pray for. as the main eurosceptic party, ukip should try to resolve its differences with kilroy to show a united front and give the uk public a serious political voice against europe. having multiple parties with the same view point just splits the vote further.

thank goodness that kilroy-silk has gone - now ukip at least has a chance in the election!

it is very sad to see the cause of britain regaining its proper relationship with europe damaged by this split within ukip. robert kilroy-silk could have a lot to offer. instead we have a split party and a damaged cause. under the present electoral system, people must work together, and small parties have no hope of representation. last summer, ukip achieved a major advance, partly and only partly due to kilroy-silk. it is a great shame this has been dissipated in in-fighting.

ukip has a wide platform of policies, not just withdrawal from the eu. this kilroy-silk conveniently ignores in the comments surrounding the launch of his own party. neither the english democrats nor the new party were interested in letting him join them and take over their leadership speaks volumes. veritas is the beginning of the end for kilroy-silk.

if he believes in truth and democracy then he and the two assembly members should resign and force a by-elections to stand on their own platform rather than this backdoor approach to politics of being elected for one party then defecting to another.

so ukip was good enough for him to lead, not good enough for him to follow!

interesting that a party committed to plain speaking should have a latin name!

every opinion poll points to an overwhelming anti-europe feeling in this country. kilroy-silk could be on the verge of something huge if he can broaden his appeal beyond this one issue. he is an extremely able communicator with years of political experience. we wants quality schools, top hospitals, clean and efficient public transport, punishments that fit the crime, limited asylum, a purge on bureaucracy and less taxes. it needs courage and honesty, two qualities sadly lacking in our politicians. kilroy-silk may just have those very qualities. recruit the right colleagues, robert, and your time may have come!

well if you cannot get enough limelight being an ordinary mp then go out and start up your own party. it's all flash and no real policy here

let's hope this is the start of both ukip and kilroy-silk slipping into obscurity.

veritas? the name will doom it. but perhaps i am wrong for surely all modern schoolchildren will understand it since they do still learn latin in the classroom do they not? the whole essence of what rks represents is euroscepticism, so explain to me how the too-twee label of veritas symbolises that?

1023,"dozens held over id fraud site

twenty-eight people, including a briton, have been arrested after a global operation against a website allegedly involved in identity fraud.

those arrested are accused of operating shadowcrew.com, which investigators claim was a global clearing house for criminals involved in credit card fraud. a 19-year-old man from camberley, surrey, was arrested by the national hi-tech crime unit but has been bailed. operation firewall, led by the us secret service, involved seven nations. the british teenager was arrested on wednesday but details only emerged on friday. he has now been bailed to return to a surrey police station in december. all 28 people detained globally are suspected of being involved in an internet-based network which stole people's identities and used computers and websites to defraud credit card companies. the authorities in the us, who have indicted 19 people in newark, new jersey, estimate the fraud caused losses of more than $4m. assistant us attorney scott christie said several people had been arrested in argentina, bulgaria, canada, estonia, poland and sweden. mr christie said one of the ringleaders was believed to be a russian, anatoly tyukanov.

investigators from 30 law enforcement agencies worldwide spent 15 months looking into the activities of three websites - shadowcrew, carderplanet and darkprofits. the us secret service was first tipped off in july 2003. an nhtcu spokeswoman said the american investigators went undercover on the shadowcrew website and discovered some of the site's 4,000 members were using it for organised crime purposes.

she said criminals were using the websites to traffic counterfeit credit cards and false identification information and documents such as credit cards, driver's licences, passports and birth certificates. the websites shared tips on how to commit fraud and provided a forum by which people could buy the information and tools they needed to commit such crime, she said. the shadowcrew site, which has now been taken over by the us secret service, listed several discussion groups, in english and russian, including one on hacking, spam and online anonymity tools. the head of the nhtcu, acting detective chief superintendent, mick deats, said: ""this investigation has resulted in the significant disruption of organised criminals using the internet for profit.

735,"reaction from spanish press

england's 1-0 defeat to spain on wednesday dominated the back and front pages of the country's press on thursday.

controversy was in no short supply, with racist abuse of england's black players, wayne rooney's petulance and england's inept performance. but what did the spanish press make of the affair? bbc sport looks at the reaction. 

 

there is little coverage of the racist chanting on wednesday night's game. but as does cover the english reaction to the pre-match comments from spain coach luis aragones, who highlighted britain's colonial past when probed about his own remarks regarding thierry henry in october. journalist guillem balague writes: ""in our country, where multi-culturalism is a new thing, we are in nappies dealing with these things, and have a naivety which makes the english nervous.""

marca refers in passing to the booing of england's black players - but only after referring to the cheers of ""ole"" which greeted the long periods of spanish possession. aragones' ""no comment"" to questions about racism after the match is also highlighted, as marca focuses on the spanish coach's praise for his players. serbia & montenegro's 2-0 world cup qualifying win in belgium - which could make qualification tougher for spain - seems to be of greater importance.

elsewhere, the spanish media criticises its english counterparts for stoking up the racism issue. ""were there racist chants against some players? this hasn't happened in the spanish league and spain for many years,"" said spanish federation press officer fernando garrido. ""so you (english reporters) should ask yourselves what you have done to contribute to all this."" and spanish daily abc accuses english reporters of launching a witch-hunt against aragones. ""perhaps it was because their team had played so poorly and they wanted to divert attention towards this muddled issue,"" the paper says. 

 

""what the boy in the bernabeu did was odd... rooney seemed intent to kick any spanish player who approached him."" yet rooney is seen only as the worst example of many england miscreants, with gary neville criticised for continuing the feud between manchester united and arsenal for his tackles on jose reyes. ashley cole's treatment of joaquin, and a frank lampard foul on reyes are also lambasted for their ""ugliness"".

marca's headline says it all: ""wayne rooney se volvi&#243; loco en el bernab&#233;u (wayne rooney became crazy in the bernabeu)"" rooney's display alarms the writer, in particular three ""chilling"" fouls on joaquin, casillas and marchena, which ""could well have left them in the infirmary."" and like as, marca criticises gary neville for ""leaving a message on reyes' ankle"" to remind him of the manchester united-arsenal clash this month. 

 

spain's first-half performance is showered with praise, with xavi singled out as the biggest star. ""xavi did things on wednesday which were worthy of maradona,"" the paper beams, adding, ""what a work-rate, what dynamism, what vision, what leadership, what a midfield player!"" on a controversial evening, as offers one seemingly undeniable viewpoint: ""spanish football players played better football than the english.""

more plaudits are given to the home team, with jaime vargas lauding the manner in which ""spain dominated england with order and quality"". the paper adds: ""the bad thing about spain v england was that it lasted only 65 minutes after which a succession of changes prevented any real competition."" vargas does not mention england's two galacticos, simply adding in a ps: ""i have not forgotten to speak of beckham and owen. they forgot to play.""
","aragones' ""no comment"" to questions about racism after the match is also highlighted, as marca focuses on the spanish coach's praise for his players.this hasn't happened in the spanish league and spain for many years,"" said spanish federation press officer fernando garrido.but what did the spanish press make of the affair?elsewhere, the spanish media criticises its english counterparts for stoking up the racism issue.and spanish daily abc accuses english reporters of launching a witch-hunt against aragones.marca refers in passing to the booing of england's black players - but only after referring to the cheers of ""ole"" which greeted the long periods of spanish possession.controversy was in no short supply, with racist abuse of england's black players, wayne rooney's petulance and england's inept performance.on a controversial evening, as offers one seemingly undeniable viewpoint: ""spanish football players played better football than the english.""""what the boy in the bernabeu did was odd... rooney seemed intent to kick any spanish player who approached him.""england's 1-0 defeat to spain on wednesday dominated the back and front pages of the country's press on thursday.but as does cover the english reaction to the pre-match comments from spain coach luis aragones, who highlighted britain's colonial past when probed about his own remarks regarding thierry henry in october.",sport,578,209
1025,"fast lifts rise into record books

two high-speed lifts at the world's tallest building have been officially recognised as the planet's fastest.

the lifts take only 30 seconds to whisk passengers to the top of the 508m tall tfc 101 tower in taipei, taiwan. the guinness book of records has declared the 17m per second speed of the two lifts the swiftest on earth. the lifts also have a pressure control system to stop passengers' ears popping as they ascend and descend at high speed.

in total, the tfc tower has 61 lifts, 34 of them double-deckers, and 50 escalators to shuttle people around its 106 floors. the tfc 101 tower is due to be officially opened on 31 december.

the super-fast lifts can speed up to 24 passengers to the tip of the tower in about 30 seconds, while ascending their 382m track. the 17m/s top speed of the lifts translates to about 38mph (61km/h). curiously the lifts take longer to descend and spend almost a whole minute returning to ground level from the top of the tfc tower. the key new technologies applied in the world's fastest elevators include:


 - a pressure control system, which adjusts the atmospheric pressure inside a car by using suction and discharge blowers, preventing ""ear popping"" 
 - an active control system which tries to balance the lift more finely and remove the sources of vibrations 
 - streamlined cars to reduce the whistling noise produced by running the lifts at a high speed inside a narrow shaft 
 

""the certification of our elevators as world record-holders by the authoritative guinness world records is a great honour for us,"" said masayuki shimono, president of manufacturer toshiba elevator and building systems which installed the lifts. the first record for the world's fastest passenger elevators was published in the first edition of the guinness book of records in 1955. ""as such, it is an interesting indicator of how technology has advanced in the 50 years since that first edition, when the record was 426m per minute, or 25.6 km/h, less than half the speed of the new record,"" said hein le roux, specialist researcher at the guinness world records. taipei's tfc 101 tower is more than 50m taller than the petronas towers in kuala lumpur, malaysia - formerly the world's tallest skyscraper.

455,"ferguson urges henry punishment

sir alex ferguson has called on the football association to punish arsenal's thierry henry for an incident involving gabriel heinze.

ferguson believes henry deliberately caught heinze on the head with his knee during united's controversial win. the united boss said it was worse than ruud van nistelrooy's foul on ashley cole for which he got a three-game ban. ""we shall present it to the fa and see what they do. the tackle on heinze was terrible,"" he said. clubs are permitted to ask the fa to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game. the clash occurred moments before half-time when a freddie ljungberg challenge left heinze on the ground on the left touchline. henry, following the ball, attempted to hurdle the argentine but his knee collided with the back of heinze's head.

the striker protested his innocence - and referee mike riley deemed the collision accidental. ferguson was also upset by arsenal's overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch-rivals and praised his own side's behaviour. ""edu produced a terrible tackle on scholes that was a potential leg-breaker,"" he said. ""there were 24 fouls in the game by arsenal, seven on heinze, five on ronaldo, six by vieira - and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked. phil neville got booked for his first challenge. ""i am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure. ""we have always been good at being gracious in defeat. what happened on sunday overshadowed our achievement, but then they do it all the time, don't they?""

1261,"smartphones suffer skulls attack

owners of some nokia smartphones are being warned to watch out for malicious wallpaper.

those downloading the software could find all the icons on their 7610 phone swapped for images of skulls. when installed the malicious program also locks many of the 7610's functions making it hard to use and harder to repair. the program is only the latest in a series of viruses produced to attack mobile phones.

the file, nicknamed skulls, is thought to have surfaced on shareware sites where people can pick up free add-ons, such as wallpaper, games and ringtones, for their phones symbian said that it was not sure if the damage skulls does was intentional or simply a result of bad programming. soon after being discovered the file is thought to have been removed from the sites that were unwittingly harbouring it. the program is masquerading as software that creates new background images and themes for the main screen of the 7610 phone. the skulls program is labelled as a file called: 7610.extended.theme.manager.zip.

once installed the program replaces all the icons on the main page with skulls and replaces all the working applications, such as contacts, calendar, notebook etc with non-working versions so the phone becomes almost useless. the only thing the phone can do is make and take calls. a statement by symbian played down the significance of the malicious program and said few people would fall victim to it as users have to go through several steps to install it, one of which includes ignoring a security warning. symbian said that the spread of the skulls program was likely to be limited as the program cannot travel from one phone to another by itself. despite this finnish anti-virus lab f-secure said it had sporadic reports of 7610 owners being caught out by it. the firm has produced guidance for users caught out to help them remove the program and get their phone working again. the skulls program is thought to have been written by a malicious hacker using the alias tee-222. symbian phones produced by sony ericsson, motorola, benq, arima and fujitsu are unaffected by the skulls program.

1296,"cyber criminals step up the pace

so-called phishing attacks that try to trick people into handing over confidential details have boomed in 2004, say security experts.

the number of phishing e-mail messages stopped by security firm messagelabs has risen more than tenfold in less than 12 months. in 2004 it detected more than 18 million phishing e-mail messages. other statistics show that in 2004 73% of all e-mail was spam and one in 16 messages were infected with a virus.

in its end-of-year report, messagelabs said that phishing had become the top security threat and most popular form of attack among cyber criminals. in september 2003, messagelabs caught only 273 phishing e-mails that tried to make people visit fake versions of the websites run by real banks and financial organisations. but by september 2004 it was stopping more than two million phishing related e-mail messages per month. worryingly, said the firm, phishing gangs were using increasingly sophisticated techniques to harvest useful information such as login details or personal data.

older attacks relied on users not spotting the fact that the site they were visiting was fake, but more recent phishing e-mails simply try to steal details as soon as a message is opened. other phishing scams try to recruit innocent people into acting as middlemen for laundering money or goods bought with stolen credit cards. ""e-mail security attacks remain unabated in their persistence and ferocity,"" said mark sunner, chief technology officer at messagelabs. ""in just 12 months phishing has firmly established itself as a threat to any organisation or individual conducting business online,"" he said. mr sunner said messagelabs was starting to see some phishing attacks become very focused on one company or organisation. ""already particular businesses are threatened and blackmailed, indicating a shift from the random, scattergun approach, to customised attacks designed to take advantage of the perceived weaknesses of some businesses,"" he said. although phishing attacks grew substantially throughout 2004, viruses and spam remain popular with cyber-criminals and vandals. one of the biggest outbreaks took place in january when the mydoom virus started circulating. to date the company has caught more than 60 million copies of the virus. also up this year was the amount of spam in circulation. in 2003 only 40% of messages were spam. but by the end of 2004, almost three-quarters of messages were junk.

1866,"china had role in yukos split-up

china lent russia $6bn (â£3.2bn) to help the russian government renationalise the key yuganskneftegas unit of oil group yukos, it has been revealed.

the kremlin said on tuesday that the $6bn which russian state bank veb lent state-owned rosneft to help buy yugansk in turn came from chinese banks. the revelation came as the russian government said rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with china. the deal sees rosneft receive $6bn in credits from china's cnpc.

according to russian newspaper vedomosti, these credits would be used to pay off the loans rosneft received to finance the purchase of yugansk. reports said cnpc had been offered 20% of yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. analysts said one factor that might have influenced the chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from yukos, yugansk's former owner, if cnpc had become a shareholder. rosneft and veb declined to comment. ""the two companies [rosneft and cnpc] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries,"" said russian oil official sergei oganesyan. ""there is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.""

the announcements help to explain how rosneft, a medium-sized, indebted, and relatively unknown firm, was able to finance its surprise purchase of yugansk. yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.

the embattled russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a us court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. but yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by rosneft. yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. once the country's richest man, mr khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.

the deal between rosneft and cnpc is seen as part of china's desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. china's thirst for products such as crude oil, copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels. ""clearly the chinese are trying to get some leverage [in russia],"" said dmitry lukashov, an analyst at brokerage aton. ""they understand property rights in russia are not the most important rights, and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies."" ""if the price of oil is fixed under the deal, which is unlikely, it could be very profitable for the chinese,"" mr lukashov continued. ""and rosneft is in desperate need of cash, so it's a good deal for them too.""

liverpool have not won the championship since 1990, a fact that causes deep discomfort inside anfield as they attempt to muscle in on the top three of chelsea, manchester united and arsenal. throw in the small matter of warding off every top club in world football as they eye captain steven gerrard, and you can see parry is a man with a lot on his plate. but in the comfort of a conference room deep inside liverpool's heartbeat - the kop end - parry spoke to us with brutal honesty about the crucial months ahead. he only dodged one question - when asked to reveal the name of the mystery investor currently courting liverpool, a polite smile deflected the inquiry. but to his credit, he met everything else head on in measured tones that underscore the belief that liverpool still mean business.

by business he means becoming title challengers again, and locking the pieces together that will help return the trophy to liverpool is parry's mission. parry has already successfully put one of those planks in place in the form of new manager rafael benitez. and his enthusiasm for the spaniard's personality and methods is an indication of his clear feeling that he has struck gold. benitez's early work has given parry renewed optimism about the years ahead. but it remains a massive task at a club with a unique history and expectations. this will not come as news to parry, a lifelong liverpool supporter, but his quiet determination suggests he is no mood to be found wanting...

captain gerrard is central to liverpool's plans and parry's insistence that all offers will be refused is a firm statement of intent. as ever, the player will have the final say, and parry acknowledges that, but he is determined to provide the framework and environment for liverpool and gerrard to flourish.

in terms of the search for new investment, hawkpoint were appointed as advisors to flush out interest in march 2004. thailand prime minister thaksin shiniwatra came and went, while the most serious statement of intent came from tycoon and lifelong fan steve morgan. morgan had a succession of bids rejected, having come close in the summer only for talks to break down over potential costs for the new stadium. bbc sport understands morgan is still ready and willing to invest in liverpool, and parry has kept the door ajar despite currently seeking investment elsewhere.

morgan, however, has had no formal contact with liverpool or their advisors since last december, blaming indecision at board level as he publicly withdrew his â£70m offer. he was also convinced his interest was being used to lure in others, so any new approach would now have to come from liverpool. morgan will certainly not be making another call. so speculation continues about the new benefactor, with trails leading to the middle east and america, but all met with an understandable veil of secrecy from anfield.

parry meanwhile sees the new ground as crucial to liverpool's future, but is refusing to become emotionally attached to the idea. he is determined the ground will only be built on an affordable basis and will not make future liverpool management hostages to the new stadium. parry will pull back the moment the figures do not stack up, but there has been a vital new development in north london that has re-shaped liverpool's thinking.

liverpool have publicly refused to entertain the idea of stadium sponsorship and potential naming rights - but the realism of arsenal's stunning â£100m deal for their new emirates stadium at ashburton has changed the landscape. parry labelled the deal ""an eye-opener"" and admits liverpool would be missing a trick not to explore the possibilities. he knows some traditionalist liverpool fans will reel at any attempt to call the new stadium anything other than just 'anfield', but the maths of modern-day football decree that multi-millions for stadium and team could ease the pain.

i would take â£50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him. as for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really?

â£50m for gerrard? i don't care who you are, the directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. we cannot let that sum of money go, despite gerrard's quality.

through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which i think is the right thing to do.

critical time for liverpool with regards to gerrard. ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. i am hoping he doesn't walk out of the club like michael owen did for very little cash.

â£50m realistically would allow rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this and keep gerrard we will be better for it. i would however be happy with gerrard's transfer for any fee over â£35m.

parry's statements are clever in that any future gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. upping the ante is another smart move by parry.

i would keep gerrard. no amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed.

the key is if gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. clearly, if he isn't, then we would be foolish not to sell. the worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-champions league football.

1711,"springer criticises opera musical

talk show host jerry springer, whose programme inspired the controversial opera shown by the bbc, has said he would not have written it himself.

the bbc received 47,000 complaints before the musical was broadcast, and protesters demonstrated outside bbc buildings across the uk. springer helped launch the west end show and attended the opening night. ""i wouldn't have written it. i don't believe in making fun of other religions,"" he said.

the tv host said he understood how people could have thought the musical had gone too far. ""you know, on our tv show if people use inappropriate language we bleep it out, if there's nudity we cover it up, so that viewers at home don't get to see any of this,"" he said.

asked whether he thought the bbc should have screened the controversial musical he said: ""i don't know if they should have had it on television but, good lord, if you don't like what's on television, that's why god gave us remote controls. ""my show is about dysfunctional people and i defy anyone to watch the show and suggest to me the people on it aren't to some degree dysfunctional.""

1195,"pc photo printers challenge pros

home printed pictures can be cheaper and higher quality than those from high street developers, tests shows.

a survey carried out by pc pro magazine looked at which of 100 home photo printers offered a better deal than handing your snaps to a photo lab. the tests found that images from top pc printers kept their colour longer than professionally produced photographs. but using the wrong printer cartridge could means snaps fade in months, warned the magazine.

the group test of 100 home photo printers for pcs discovered how much it costs to create images using the devices compared to online developers as well as high street names such as jessops, boots and snappy snaps. the comprehensive test also revealed how quickly different printers produced images, the quality of the finished image and how resistant finished pictures were to smudging or water damage. it found that although some ink for printers now costs more than â£2 per millilitre it can still be cheaper to produce prints from photographs at home than it is to send them off to a high street store. ""if you really like your photos, then it's definitely worth printing at home instead of going to the high street, but only if you choose the right printer,"" said nick ross, top tester at pc pro.

mr ross said that a new generation of printers produced images with brighter colours and that were less likely to fade than many high street developers or even some professional wedding photographers. some high street photo shops can be the cheapest when it came to developing prints that were 6x4in, said mr ross, but the test revealed that images 7x5in and 8x10in in size were cheaper to produce at home. according to pc pro, producing a print 8x10in on an epson r800 printer using top quality paper costs â£1.87. at jessops the same image would cost â£2.50 and at snappy snaps â£9.99. a 10x7in snap at boots would cost â£4.99. ""considering how inconvenient it can be to go to the high street and how silver-halide prints can fade in the sun, we're adamant that it's now better, cheaper and more convenient to print at home,"" he said. ann simpson, marketing manager at snappy snaps believes the convenience of high street printing will continue to attract customers. ""some people will want to do their own thing on their computer but the feedback to us is that customers often have to print two or three pictures at home in order to get a good one,"" she said. ""many people are not skilled at getting the colour, contrast and cropping right and they don't want the hassle,"" she added. the magazine test found that which ink consumers use determined how long their prints lasted before they started fading. it recommended avoiding so-called third-party inks not produced by printer makers because they tended to produce prints that fade the quickest.

1006,"'brainwave' cap controls computer

a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer.

four people, two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users, successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes. previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain. the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. ""the results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions,"" said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane. the research team, from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany, said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought.

the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which, meant no surgery or implantation was needed.

brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes. complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer. such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles, so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively. ""the impressive non-invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non-invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm, a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis,"" said the researchers. the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried. although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall, the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated. it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain-control experiments. some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques. earlier this year, a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.

1555,"csi shows give 'unrealistic view'

people have unrealistic expectations of forensic science thanks to the success of the csi tv shows, real experts say.

evidence submitted to forensic labs has shot up as a result of the programmes, at a time when many have large backlogs, science investigators claim. lawyers also fear the effect because jurors have a distorted view of how forensic evidence is used. the issue was discussed at a major science conference in washington dc. crime scene investigation (csi) and its spin-offs, csi: miami and csi: new york, have proven exceptionally popular with audiences on both sides of the atlantic.

each episode, a team of forensic investigators goes about solving a crime through the ingenious appliance of science - and the extensive resources at their disposal. ""the csi effect is basically the perception of the near-infallibility of forensic science in response to the tv show,"" said max houck, who runs a forensic science graduate course at west virginia university, us. ""this tv show comes on and everyone starts watching it - including the cops and prosecutors - and submissions to forensic laboratories go through the roof,"" he told the annual meeting of the american association for the advancement of science (aaas). the american forensics expert said there were roughly 200,000-300,000 backlogged dna samples in us labs. yet these constituted just 10% of the total test backlog, said dr houck. forensic pathologist dr patricia mcfeeley said she had started to see the show's influence in dealing with the families of victims. ""what i find is that families now are more dissatisfied with the investigation than was previously the case,"" she explained. ""for example, on television, the toxicology results are available almost instantaneously. but when people find out that it can take several months, they can find that very difficult.""

dr mcfeeley added that the accuracy with which forensic investigators can determine time of death was far lower than most people's perceptions. the show's influence can follow forensic investigators all the way into the courtroom, making lawyers jittery. ""prosecutors fear the csi effect with juries because, for example, they wonder: 'why wasn't everything tested?' well, in fact, not everything needs to be tested,"" dr houck explained. ""defence attorneys also worry about the csi effect because they think that jurors come in and have this view of science as a juggernaut; this objective method that's always accurate."" however, he admitted the show had had positive as well as negative effects on the field. ""my university course started with four graduates in 1999; we're now the largest major on campus - with 400 students,"" he said. dr houck added that there was an urgent need for better funding of forensic science at the university level: ""there's more money spent in this country on holistic medicine than there is on forensic science research.""

1262,"cyber crime booms in 2004

the last 12 months have seen a dramatic growth in almost every security threat that plague windows pcs.

the count of known viruses broke the 100,000 barrier and the number of new viruses grew by more than 50%. similarly phishing attempts, in which conmen try to trick people into handing over confidential data, are recording growth rates of more than 30% and attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated. also on the increase are the number of networks of remotely controlled computers, called bot nets, used by malicious hackers and conmen to carry out many different cyber crimes.

one of the biggest changes of 2004 was the waning influence of the boy hackers keen to make a name by writing a fast-spreading virus, said kevin hogan, senior manager in symantec's security response group. although teenage virus writers will still play around with malicious code, said mr hogan, 2004 saw a significant rise in criminal use of malicious programs. the financial incentives were driving criminal use of technology, he said. his comment was echoed by graham cluley, senior technology consultant from anti-virus firm sophos. mr cluley said: ""when the commercial world gets involved, things really get nasty. virus writers and hackers will be looking to make a tidy sum.""

in particular, phishing attacks, which typically use fake versions of bank websites to grab login details of customers, boomed during 2004. web portal lycos europe reported a 500% increase in the number of phishing e-mail messages it was catching. the anti-phishing working group reported that the number of phishing attacks against new targets was growing at a rate of 30% or more per month. those who fall victim to these attacks can find that their bank account has been cleaned out or that their good name has been ruined by someone stealing their identity. this change in the ranks of virus writers could mean the end of the mass-mailing virus which attempts to spread by tricking people into opening infected attachments on e-mail messages. ""they are not an efficient way of spreading viruses,"" said mr hogan. ""they are very noisy and they are not technically challenging."" the opening months of 2004 did see the appearance of the netsky, bagle and mydoom mass mailers, but since then more surreptitious viruses, or worms, have dominated.

mr hogan said worm writers were more interested in recruiting pcs to take part in ""bot nets"" that can be used to send out spam or to mount attacks on websites.

in september symantec released statistics which showed that the numbers of active ""bot computers"" rose from 2,000 to 30,000 per day. thanks to these ""bot nets"", spam continued to be a problem in 2004. anti-spam firms report that, in many cases, legitimate e-mail has shrunk to less than 30% of messages. part of the reason that these ""bot nets"" have become so prevalent, he said, was due to a big change in the way that many viruses were created. in the past many viruses, such as netsky, have been the work of an individual or group. by contrast, said mr hogan, the code for viruses such as gaobot, spybot and randex were commonly held and many groups work on them to produce new variants at the same time. the result is that now there are more than 3,000 variations of the spybot worm. ""that's unprecedented,"" said mr hogan. ""what makes it difficult is that they are all co-existing with each other and do not exist in an easy to understand chronology.""

the emergence of the first proper virus for mobile phones was also seen in 2004.

in the past, threats to smart phones have been largely theoretical because the viruses created to cripple phones existed only in the laboratory rather than the wild. in june, the cabir virus was discovered that can hop from phone to phone using bluetooth short-range radio technology. also released this year was the mosquito game for symbian phones which surreptitiously sends messages to premium rate numbers, and in november the skulls trojan came to light which can cripple phones. on the positive side, finnish security firm f-secure said that 2004 was the best-ever year for the capture, arrest and sentencing of virus writers and criminally-minded hackers. in total, eight virus writers were arrested and some members of the so-called 29a virus writing group were sentenced. one high-profile arrest was that of german teenager sven jaschen who confessed to be behind the netsky and sasser virus families. also shut down were the carderplanet and shadowcrew websites that were used to trade stolen credit card numbers.

the fall came as indonesia said it expected debt repayments of up to 30 trillion rupiah ($3.2bn; â£1.7bn) to be frozen to help pay for the recovery. by monday's close, the jakarta stock exchange was down 2.1% at 1,011.15. bar a slight dip at the new year, the jse had risen steadily by 4.7% since the tsunami hit on 26 december. construction and property companies in particular have gained ground, although banks were among the main fallers on monday.

so far, more than 100,000 people are believed to have been killed in indonesia, the country closest to the earthquake which triggered the great wave.

on friday, the government said its five-year estimate of rebuilding costs for banda aceh province - much of which was flattened by the quake and the tsunami - was 20 trillion rupiah ($2.2bn; â£1.1bn), twice what it had previously estimated. that cost could be defrayed by temporary debt relief. on monday, indonesian economy minister aburizal bakrie told reporters that the paris club group of creditor countries was expected to freeze 20-30bn rupiah in payments due in 2005 and 2006. ""we hope we can resume the repayments at least from 2007,"" mr bakrie said. french finance minister herve gaymard said on sunday that the paris club had already agreed to a moratorium on repayments for tsunami-hit countries ahead of its meeting on 12 january.

2085,"reliance unit loses anil ambani

anil ambani, the younger of the two brothers in charge of india's largest private company, has resigned from running its petrochemicals subsidiary.

the move is likely to be seen as the latest twist in a feud between mr ambani and his brother mukesh. anil, 45, has stepped down as director and vice-chairman of indian petrochemicals corporation (ipc). the company was not available for comment. ipc is 46%-owned by reliance industries which in turn is run by mukesh. mukesh has spoken of ownership issues between the two brothers, who took over control of the reliance empire following the death of their father in july, 2002.

reliance's operations have massive reach, covering textiles, telecommunications, petrochemicals, petroleum refining and marketing, as well as oil and gas exploration, insurance and financial services. the brothers' spat has hogged headlines in india during recent weeks, despite a denial from the family that there was anything wrong. speculation has been rife about what has triggered the stand-off, with some observers blaming anil's political ambitions, others the heavy investment by mukesh and reliance in a mobile phone venture. shares of ipc dipped on the news in mumbai, but recovered to trade almost 6% higher. reliance shares added 1.7%, while reliance energy, headed by anil, jumped 7%.

1791,"beer giant swallows russian firm

brewing giant inbev has agreed to buy alfa-eco's stake in sun interbrew, russia's second-largest brewer, for up to 259.7m euros ($353.3m; â£183.75m).

alfa-eco, the venture capital arm of russian conglomerate alfa group, has a one-fifth stake in sun interbrew. the deal gives inbev, the world's biggest beermaker, near-total control over the russian brewer. inbev bought out another partner in august 2004. inbev brands include bass, stella artois, hoegaarden and staropramen. it employs 77,000 people, running operations in over 30 countries across the americas, europe and asia pacific.

the leuven-based brewery said it would own 97.3% of the voting shares and 98.8% of the non-voting shares of sun interbrew. the deal is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2005. inbev was formed in august 2004 when belgium's interbrew bought brazilian brewer ambev. sun interbrew, which employs 8,000 staff, owns breweries in eight russian cities - klin, ivanovo, saransk, kursk, volzhsky, omsk, perm and novocheboksarsk. there are also three breweries in ukraine, in the cities of chernigov, nikolaev and kharkov.

1302,"parents face video game lessons

ways of ensuring that parents know which video games are suitable for children are to be considered by the games industry.

the issue was discussed at a meeting between uk government officials, industry representatives and the british board of film classification. it follows concerns that children may be playing games aimed at adults which include high levels of violence. in 2003, britons spent â£1,152m on games, more than ever before. and this christmas, parents are expected to spend millions on video games and consoles.

violent games have been hit by controversy after the game manhunt was blamed by the parents of 14-year-old stefan pakeerah, who was stabbed to death in leicester in february. his mother, giselle, said her son's killer, warren leblanc, 17 - who was jailed for life in september - had mimicked behaviour in the game.

police investigating stefan's murder dismissed its influence and said manhunt was not part of its legal case. the issue of warnings on games for adults was raised on sunday by trade and industry secretary patricia hewitt. this was the focus of the talks between government officials, representatives from the games industry and the british board of film classification. ""adults can make informed choices about what games to play. children can't and they deserve to be protected,"" said culture secretary tessa jowell after the meeting. ""industry will consider how to make sure parents know what games their children should and shouldn't play."" roger bennett, director general of entertainment and leisure software publishers association, said: ""a number of initiatives were discussed at the meeting. ""they will be formulated to create specific proposals to promote greater understanding, recognition and awareness of the games rating system, ensuring that young people are not exposed to inappropriate content.""

among the possible measures could be a campaign to explain to parents that many games are made for an adult audience, as well as changes to the labelling of the games themselves.

according to industry statistics, a majority of players are over 18, with the average age of a gamer being 29. academics point out that there has not been any definitive research linking bloodthirsty games such as manhunt with violent responses in players. in a report published this week for the video standards council, dr guy cumberbatch said: ""the research evidence on media violence causing harm to viewers is wildly exaggerated and does not stand up to scrutiny."" dr cumberbatch, head of the social policy think tank, the communications research group, reviewed the studies on the issue. he concluded that there was an absence of convincing research that media violence caused harm.

2187,"bank opts to leave rates on hold

the bank of england has left interest rates on hold at 4.75% for a sixth month in a row.

the bank's monetary policy committee (mpc) decided to take no action amid mixed signals from the economy. but some economists predict a further rise in the cost of borrowing will come later this year. interest rates rose five times between november 2003 and august 2004 as soaring house prices and buoyant consumer data sparked inflation fears. bank of england governor mervyn king has recently warned against placing too much weight on one month's economic data, suggesting the mpc is waiting for a clearer picture to emerge. economists see next week's inflation report from the mpc as key in assessing whether a further interest rate rise is necessary to keep the economy in check.

slower consumer spending and a quieter housing market are likely to have convinced the mpc that rates should be left unchanged in recent months. inflation, however, has been rising faster than expected, hitting an annual rate of 1.6% in december - its highest level in six months. data on wednesday also showed manufacturing output rose at its fastest rate since may last month, reinforcing a view that economic growth was stronger than forecasts.

and recent house surveys from the halifax and nationwide have indicated prices are still rising, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. philip shaw, chief economist at investec securities, said he believed rates would remain at 4.75% for the rest of the year although strong economic data could lead to a further hike. ""the economic landscape has changed quite considerably over the last couple of months, "" he said. ""growth appears stronger and the mpc may become more concerned about inflation trends."" howard archer, economist at global insight said the mpc ""may well consider that the balance of risks to the growth and inflation outlook have moved from the downside to the upside"".

business groups welcomed the mpc's widely-expected move to leave rates on hold and cautioned against further rises. the british chambers of commerce (bcc) said it was ""concerned by the clamour in some quarters"" for early interest rate increases. ""we believe that these demands should be firmly resisted,"" said david frost, bcc director general. ""manufacturing still faces extremely serious problems and is performing poorly, in spite of the recent revised figures."" ian mccafferty, chief economist at the cbi, said the mpc faced an ""interesting"" challenge. ""consumers appear to have pulled in their horns over the holiday period, and exporters are struggling with the strength of sterling,"" he said. ""however, the broader economy continues to show healthy growth, and the tight labour market and buoyant commodity prices are nudging inflation higher.""

224,"brown hits back in blair rift row

gordon brown has criticised a union leader who said conflict between himself and tony blair was harming the workings of government.

jonathan baume, of the top civil servants' union, spoke of ""competing agendas"" between mr brown and mr blair. but the chancellor said mr baume was never at meetings between himself and the prime minister so could not judge. he said the union leader was trying to block civil service reform which threatened his members' jobs. it suited the purpose of mr baume's union, the first division association, to suggest there were two agendas battling against each other because the union was trying to resist the planned reforms, mr brown told bbc radio 4's today programme.

under the plans, unveiled in the gershon report, some 84,000 civil servants jobs will be axed or changed and the savings ploughed back into frontline services. mr brown said: ""to be honest i don't think you can rely on his [mr baume's] judgement on this matter when it comes to the decisions that the government are making. ""mr blair and i are making exactly the same decisions on civil service reforms. we are determined to go on with the gershon reforms."" he also said that as mr baume was never present at meetings between himself and the prime minister, he was not in a position to judge. on wednesday, ahead of the chancellor's pre-budget report, mr baume told bbc news there were sometimes ""conflicting and competing agendas for government"" between number 10 and the treasury.

what the chancellor wanted was ""not by any means what alan milburn and the prime minister want to see"", mr baume said. ""government departments get their money from the treasury on the basis of public service agreements they sign up to, but at the same time the prime minister also has an agenda and that's not necessarily the same as the treasury's and the prime minister is of course a very powerful figure in any government. ""he also sends instructions and messages and directions to departments about how he would like each secretary of state and each department to implement a policy agenda. ""the problem is that on many occasions these two don't add up and individual cabinet ministers as well as departments have to make sense of this battle."" number 10 said ministers were interested in governing and not a ""soap opera"" about mr blair and mr brown. tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin said: ""the battle royal that the top civil servants are now reporting on between the chancellor and tony blair is preventing them both from getting on with the business of getting taxpayers value for money.""

1735,"s korean credit card firm rescued

south korea's largest credit card firm has averted liquidation following a one trillion won ($960m; â£499m) bail-out.

lg card had been threatened with collapse because of its huge debts but the firm's creditors and its former parent have stepped in to rescue it. a consortium of creditors and lg group, a family owned conglomerate, have each put up $480m to stabilise the firm. lg card has seven million customers and its collapse would have sent shockwaves through the country's economy.

the firm's creditors - which own 99% of lg card - have been trying to agree a deal to secure its future for several weeks. they took control of the company in january when it avoided bankruptcy only through a $4.5bn bail-out.

they had threatened to delist the company, a move which would have triggered massive debt redemptions and forced the company into bankruptcy, unless agreement was reached on its future funding. ""lg card will not need any more financial aid after this,"" laah chong-gyu, executive director of korea development bank - one of the firm's creditors - said.

the agreement will see some 12 trillion won of debt converted into equity. ""the purpose of the capital injection is to avoid delisting and the goal will be met,"" david kim, an analyst at sejong securities, told reuters. south korea's consumer credit market has been slowly recovering from a crisis in 2002 when a credit bubble burst and millions of consumers fell behind on their debt repayments. lg card returned to profit in september but needed further capital to avoid being thrown off the market. south korea's stock exchange can delist any firm if its debt exceeds its assets two years running.

412,"minimum wage increased to â£5.05

the minimum wage will rise in october, benefiting more than 1m people, the government has announced.

adults must be paid at least â£5.05 an hour, up from â£4.85, while 18 to 21 year olds will be paid â£4.25. the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999. businesses wanted it frozen, warning more rises could damage competitiveness but the unions want a â£6 rate.

a further increase in the adult rate to â£5.35 an hour is provisionally scheduled for october 2006. according to the commission, many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage ""challenging"". ""we have therefore recommended only a slight increase above average earnings, and concentrated it in the second year to allow business more time to absorb the impact,"" said chairman adair turner. the government says most of those on the minimum wage are women - with many working in cleaning, catering, shops and hairdressing.

unveiling the latest increase, mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a ""symbol of decency and fairness"". ""for too long, poverty pay capped the aspiration and prosperity of far too many hard-working families,"" he said. ""too often, people were told to make a choice between the indignity of unemployment or the humiliation of poverty pay."" chancellor gordon brown and transport secretary alistair darling promoted the news in edinburgh, wales secretary peter hain and welsh first minister rhodri morgan in cardiff and northern ireland minister john spellar in belfast. the government has not accepted the commission's recommendation that 21-year-olds should be paid at the adult rate, but says it will look again at the rate later on. mr brown said: ""we want to do nothing that can damage the employment opportunities for young people, particularly young people entering the labour market for the first time."" the government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage.

the national minimum wage is currently set at â£4.85 per hour for those aged 22 and above, and at â£4.10 for those aged 18 to 21. a â£3 per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for 16 to 17-year-olds, but apprentices are exempt. the trade unions congress welcomed the increase, but has called for a â£6 minimum wage by next year. but the confederation of british industry (cbi) called for a ""pause year"" to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in october. and david frost, director of the british chambers of commerce, said: ""the level of increase each year has increased by rates far outstripping the rates of inflation. ""what employers are saying to us now is that it's at a level where it's starting to bite into the competitiveness of companies right across the country.""

the liberal democrats' economics spokesman vincent cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage. ""it's not just good for the workers themselves but it lifts them out of benefits and therefore is good for the exchequer too,"" he said. conservative leader michael howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not ""seek to disturb"" the increase. speaking on bbc radio 4's woman's hour, mr howard hinted the tories might go into the general election with a promise to cancel income tax for the lowest-paid workers. ""there are people on very low salaries, very low incomes indeed who really shouldn't be paying income tax,"" he said.

it would be better to decrease taxes on earnings below â£12,000 a year, with say no tax on below â£6,000. the losses in tax can be recouped by having a 50pc tax band for people making over â£100,000. our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage, yet our economy per person is only 2/3rds of the us! perhaps, we have to really starting questioning why some products cost 50-60% more here than they do in the us. this combined with the tax decreases would make the pounds the low-paid people do make go much further.

it's still not good enough! i got a part time job at 16 when i was doing my a-levels in an attempt to get a little money saved for uni. this was only 2 years ago and i was getting paid â£2.75 an hour, and working as hard as any of the older staff, maybe it's about time 16 - 21 year olds got a fair wage!

we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad. still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it. an easy way for the government to do as it preaches would be to insist on floor pay levels for all government workers and take tens of thousand of civil servants out of the social security system all together.

any increase is certainly welcome news. however for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them: ""would you be happy to work for less than â£5.05 an hour?"". thought not ... so then, don't expect others to either.

i can't believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage! also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you? it's about time that these hardworking people are rewarded with only what they deserve and have earned fair pay and a bit of respect wouldn't go a miss either. br /&gt;

this is good news. the minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a worker's relationship with their employer. wages are supposed to be a fair reflection of an employee's efforts. for too long wages were a point of exploitation - what could an employer get away with. in very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep low-paid wages low. with the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removed.

it is also interesting to read the comments from so called business leaders. they are the first to defend the rights and privileges of boards to award fat-cat salaries, bonuses and pension rights to the select few but they are the first to attack policies that are put in place to merely defend the rights of those that really make those fat cats purr!

i feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase, on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people can't afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life. its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out.

here come the usual whines about how difficult it will be for businesses! we all remember michael howard's protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced - funny how he's gone quiet on that one! jobs have continued to increase since this humane legislation was brought in. i think if any job is worth doing then it's worth being paid a fair wage for, and â£5.05 is hardly a fortune. if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it's not being run properly and if it folds, a better-run company will take over its duties and employ more people, so everybody wins except incompetent business owners!

great keep at it tony, i remember the despair of the 80s and the low wages employers got away with. at last we can make a difference to people and reward them for working. we can't afford not to pay a decent wage. it's not a jobs at any price economy, goodbye sweatshops hello decency.

the increase in minimum wage is a good thing. living in the southwest where house prices and rent have increased hugely (like the rest of the country) over the past 5 years has made living for you average 18-21 years old very difficult. in the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay, for example a job i did in plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in exeter by 75p an hour. hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level, and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard, but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own.

i work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services - domestic, catering & portering etc - pay the minimum wage of â£4.85 as the basic rate. someone has to do these unglamorous jobs and earn enough to live decently. how dare people suggest we are lazy or complacent for accepting these jobs and these wages? who do they think will be carrying out these public service jobs if contractors are allowed to pay as little as their consciences allow?

this is definitely the right step in the right direction. it shows that this government cares for the low income earners as well. this is a million votes more. good strategy isn't it?

although i would not deny people the minimum wage increase, its timing stinks. i am quite prepared for a raft of 'bribes' to come from the government before the election and a raft of taxes afterwards, they are playing us for the fools they think we are.

this is extremely bad news for any business - whether they are small and medium enterprises or even large companies. by increasing overheads, for business, there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt, or that pair of trainers for next to nothing. the extra cost this increase will bring, will only be reflected in the price of the goods we buy, which, in turn will only serve to discourage companies from setting-up business in the uk, or encourage those companies already based here to look elsewhere. the jubilation felt by ""low-paid"" workers here will soon give way to misery as they lose their jobs.

this will only lead to a reduction in jobs. why have many of the call centre jobs gone to india. blair say's the economy is ""strong and stable economy"" however consumer debt and the country's debt is at its highest and now they heap this onto businesses, that will have no choice but to cut the workforce.

the timing cannot be coincidental. this is blatant electioneering and should be exposed as such.

andrew in derby complains that raising the minimum wage is 'blatant electioneering'. i don't mind if it is. in our degraded democracy, elections are the one time when elites really have to worry about doing something concrete for the majority. my only complaint is the paltry figures being discussed. if my maths is right, a 35 hour week at â£5.05 gives you an annual income just over â£9,000 and raising it to â£6 leaves it under â£11,000. the unions should be putting the government under pressure for much more. businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay, shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firm.

i am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level, but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers. also small businesses will have to be able to afford this manpower cost. we are already seeing a sweeping change in it work being lost to india where people are paid much less. it is difficult for me to understand that only five years ago cheap labour abroad was classified as 'sweat shop', but now we are told it is global competition. with our manufacturing industry in serious decline the country cannot be entirely service industries without something tangible to serve. there has to be something at the top of the food chain and that is manufacturing. the whole picture needs to be looked at.

this is great news, but that might be because i work for minimum wage. seems a good idea and will hopefully be an incentive to those who live to claim to actually get a job. when you can ""earn"" more from claiming than you can from work, there is no incentive. perhaps a step in the right direction.

if the tuc get their way a very large number of smes will have to close - this will put more people out of work. how then will the government fudge the unemployment figures! the government know it is not big business that keeps the economy going but the smes but we always get overlooked, they will only take notice if these large corporations close and move to other countries, after all they are predominantly owned by foreign companies. we are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us.

while i'm delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward, i am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses. as an employee for a small nursery, i know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer, who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last october's increase for the lower paid employees - who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum. this latest increase of 20p an hour will cause even more financial hardship. if the rate rises to â£6 then i can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees.

the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business. although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential. the raise is well above inflation and without significant increases in sales, it will mean that i will not be taking on a new member of staff as planned and i will be looking to reduce the total hours worked by the other members of staff, overtime being the first to go.

i currently employ 42 staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wage. increases above inflation are fine but all of my business is conducted with local authorities who will not accept above inflation rises in my service delivery. 80% of my costs are labour. the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase, thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses

it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the ""lower status"" jobs.

i know about this great idea - don't bother getting qualifications, laze about at school, no need to do anything other than attend so your parents don't get fined because remember, when you do eventually start working, doesn't matter how lazy you are, you'll be guaranteed a decent wage. the ones who suffer are the employers.

i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won't take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping, or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door?

i don't believe in the minimum wage at all! i think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them. now, before everyone thinks that i am some ""rich-kid"", i can assure you i am not. i came from a very much working class background and started work 20 years ago on a youth opportunity program earning â£25 per week. i worked hard, went to college part time, got my a-levels and degree & bettered myself. i now earn a 6 figure salary. i did that through hard work and getting off my backside. a minimum wage just makes people complacent.

to ashley, of swindon: when you earned â£25 per week, it was worth something. these days that â£25 would need to be near to â£60 to have the equivalent buying power. i might add, that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation, people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages. ""in my day"" type arguments are a view that belong in the 'your day' - 20 years ago!

as a graduate working for minimum wage, i welcome any increase of pay i can get. i disagree with ashley, swindon saying i have to work harder to get more pay. i have my gcse's a-levels and a degree and have chosen to work for a small business that can't afford the wages i should be getting, i should be on at least 3x what i'm getting but they can't afford it. we all work hard but the money is just not there. but on the plus side i love my job and wouldn't change it just to get more pay.

as an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional â£5000 per year. these next rises will cost me more. i have to get the money from somewhere so pass it on to customers. so no one really wins in the end.

in answer to emma from sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end... on the contrary mr blair wins - he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well. if the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the â£6.00 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt - namely mine. think of us employers as well mr blair, we are not all big corporations earning millions.

all workers should be entitled to a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. how many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirement?

it is good news for many asians living in uk. students who do odd jobs can increase their income and can help there family in their home country. i thank mr. blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage.
","the increase in minimum wage is a good thing.as a graduate working for minimum wage, i welcome any increase of pay i can get.the increase in minimum wage will have a serious effect on my business.a minimum wage just makes people complacent.although i would not deny people the minimum wage increase, its timing stinks.i thank mr. blair and his government for increase in the national minimum wage.the minimum wage will rise in october, benefiting more than 1m people, the government has announced.i don't believe in the minimum wage at all!this is great news, but that might be because i work for minimum wage.hopefully the increase in the minimum wage will bring in to balance pay on a regional and national level, and in turn allow people like myself who do work hard, but might never earn a 6 figure salary the chance to branch out on our own.the other aspect that is always hidden is that the thresholds for tax credits do not move in line with these increases so that all that happens is that employees tax credit support is reduced by the amount of the increase, thereby saving the government money but increasing the financial burden on small to medium businesses  it is very good that the government has decided to increase the minimum wage - this should hopefully motivate people to undertake the ""lower status"" jobs.i think jobs should create their own wage value and that if people want higher wages they should earn them.the trade unions congress welcomed the increase, but has called for a â£6 minimum wage by next year.the government has said it will look at tougher action against the small number of employers who consistently refuse to pay the minimum wage.if the minimum wage increases again and if it hits anywhere near the â£6.00 mark there will be 12 more people on the employment line and one more small business going bankrupt - namely mine.i currently employ 42 staff whose wages mirror the national minimum wage.according to the commission, many businesses had found the last two significant increases in the minimum wage ""challenging"".we must remember that the minimum wage is only part of the picture and must not rise to a level that makes employing people unattractive and encourages businesses to send work and therefore jobs abroad.however for all those whining about the pressures of an increase in the minimum wage i would simply ask them: ""would you be happy to work for less than â£5.05 an hour?"".i can't believe that so many of these comments are against the minimum wage!as an employer of staff in several shops the last rise in the minimum wage cost my company an additional â£5000 per year.our minimum wage is going to be effectively almost twice the us minimum wage, yet our economy per person is only 2/3rds of the us!by increasing overheads, for business, there will be an almost certain rise in costs to the consumer who while they openly welcome the idea of an increase in the minimum wage are the same people who still want to buy that shirt, or that pair of trainers for next to nothing.the recommendations came from the low pay commission which said the number of jobs had continued to grow since the minimum wage was introduced in 1999.still government and local councils employ staff via their contractors that pay at the minimum wage or very close to it.i might add, that thanks to successive governments holding down the tax allowance threshold below inflation, people earning the minimum wage are paying taxes that they never would have done 10 years ago at equivalent wages.we all remember michael howard's protestations that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs when it was introduced - funny how he's gone quiet on that one!in answer to emma from sleaford regarding no one really wins in the end... on the contrary mr blair wins - he wins because he obviously has announced this to be a vote winner and his treasury wins because as an employer you will know that the amount of tax and national insurance that the government will receive from all the minimum wage increases will rise and of course not only will be paying out higher wages but as an employer higher employer ni contributions as well.unveiling the latest increase, mr blair said he wanted the minimum wage to become a ""symbol of decency and fairness"".conservative leader michael howard said he accepted the principle of the minimum wage and would not ""seek to disturb"" the increase.how many people on the minimum wage have any hope of obtaining a mortgage or saving towards retirement?although we pay above the minimum level we will have to increase our pay rates to maintain the differential.the government says most of those on the minimum wage are women - with many working in cleaning, catering, shops and hairdressing.a â£3 per hour minimum wage was introduced last october for 16 to 17-year-olds, but apprentices are exempt.i work at a large hospital where the contractors providing all ancillary services - domestic, catering & portering etc - pay the minimum wage of â£4.85 as the basic rate.andrew in derby complains that raising the minimum wage is 'blatant electioneering'.the minimum wage has put a sense of equality back into a worker's relationship with their employer.with the minimum wage this downward pressure is at least partly removed.we can't afford not to pay a decent wage.as an employee for a small nursery, i know this increase will cause great hardship for my employer, who has been unable to increase salaries for higher paid employees because of last october's increase for the lower paid employees - who were originally being paid slightly above the minimum but are now on the minimum.but the confederation of british industry (cbi) called for a ""pause year"" to assess the impact of the above inflation rise in the minimum wage in october.its true many may get complacent but the minimum wage could be looked at as more of a stepping stone rather than a hand out.i hope that if industry and business have to pay this new rate that mr blair and mr brown will increase tax allowances and raise national insurance thresholds so that the treasury won't take some of this increase off the people they say they are helping, or is this just another form of stealth tax on business through the back door?this was only 2 years ago and i was getting paid â£2.75 an hour, and working as hard as any of the older staff, maybe it's about time 16 - 21 year olds got a fair wage!also i personally take great offence at the insinuation that people earning minimum wage were lazy at school if everyone went to university then who would serve you in the supermarkets and clean up after you?i am all for lifting the minimum wage of workers to a reasonable level, but we have to accept that with this will come competition from overseas workers.in the south west the increase in living costs have not been matched by an increase in pay, for example a job i did in plymouth was underpaid to an equivalent worker in exeter by 75p an hour.the national minimum wage is currently set at â£4.85 per hour for those aged 22 and above, and at â£4.10 for those aged 18 to 21.if your business cannot pay its workers a decent wage then maybe it's not being run properly and if it folds, a better-run company will take over its duties and employ more people, so everybody wins except incompetent business owners!the liberal democrats' economics spokesman vincent cable said he supported the move to raise the minimum wage.i think if any job is worth doing then it's worth being paid a fair wage for, and â£5.05 is hardly a fortune.i feel there are both negatives and positives to the increase, on one hand some businesses will struggle to stay afloat but on the other hand in today world many young people can't afford to move out as property costs too much and only by earning more will they be able to get on in life.if the rate rises to â£6 then i can foresee many small businesses having to pay off employees.for too long wages were a point of exploitation - what could an employer get away with.i have my gcse's a-levels and a degree and have chosen to work for a small business that can't afford the wages i should be getting, i should be on at least 3x what i'm getting but they can't afford it.in very simplistic terms this put a pressure to keep low-paid wages low.great keep at it tony, i remember the despair of the 80s and the low wages employers got away with.businesses complaining might like to take a look at corporate pay, shareholder payouts and profits before wondering if paying a living wage is really a controlling factor in the viability of their firm.while i'm delighted for those on low pay that this increase is being put forward, i am extremely concerned at the implications for small businesses.we are a specialist company but with these increases have already had an effect on us and we have lost work another one will close us.",politics,3295,1545
176,"labour attacked on howard poster

labour has been accused of using anti-semitic images in posters which critics claim depict tory leader michael howard as fagin.

the poster shows mr howard hypnotising people with a pocket watch, saying: ""i can spend the same money twice."" the image prompted concern from the editor of the jewish chronicle but labour insists it is simply anti-tory. labour later took the image off its website, saying an alternative idea had proved more popular with party members. the party will now use focus groups to test a poster showing mr howard and shadow chancellor oliver letwin with a blackboard reading: ""2+2=5"".

the hypnotism poster has been compared to the portrayal of the dickens character fagin in the stage version of the musical oliver! there was controversy over another poster choice offered to labour members. it showed mr howard and mr letwin - who are both jewish - as flying pigs. mr howard did not comment on the anti-semitism claims when asked about the poster on monday. instead, he pointed to how tony blair had in 1997 complained about ""personalised abusive campaigning"". mr howard told greater manchester radio: ""it is such a pity that mr blair doesn't practise what he preaches.""

jewish chronicle editor ned temko said there had been a mixed reaction to the first poster but e-mails from jewish chronicle readers showed deeper concern about the hypnotism image. ""shylock and fagin are inextricably linked to notions of centuries-old prejudice,"" he told bbc radio 4's world at one. ""whatever the idea is, i think it's a difficult exercise to use images like that and to argue that you can divorce them from their historical context or meaning."" mr temko said he blamed ""cock-up not conspiracy"", saying he did not detect inherent anti-semitism in any of the parties' election campaigns.

the poster is among one of a series of ideas shown to labour members, who have been asked to choose which one should be used ahead of the election. labour mp louise ellman said the hypnotism image was insensitive but urged people not to rush to call things anti-semitic when they only challenged tory economic policies. labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said the poster had been misunderstood. the image simply portrayed mr howard as a hypnotist, he argued. ""concern has been expressed and clearly we have to take those views on board but i would emphasise that if you see the posters, the common theme... is that the tories are trying to con you."" a labour spokesman later said the timing of removing the controversial image from the party's website was not affected by the row. ""this has been up on the website for two weeks and there has only been a fuss in the last four days so a substantial number of people voted before there was any fuss,"" he said. but a conservative spokeswoman said: ""this poster campaign - which was offensive to many people - was a big misjudgement by labour's campaign team.""

405,"blair returns from peace mission

prime minister tony blair has arrived back from his diplomatic mission to the middle east to try to resurrect the peace process.

mr blair held talks with his israeli counterpart, ariel sharon, and the palestinian leader, mahmoud abbas. he confirmed that a renewed drive to reform the palestinian authority and address security issues would come at a london conference in march. mr blair also made a surprise trip to iraq this week. the israelis described the meeting as important but said they would not need to attend. mr blair briefly visited the tomb of yasser arafat in ramallah - the first world leader to do so. he nodded briefly towards the tomb, rather than lay a wreath, in what palestinian officials said was a compromise gesture agreed at the last minute.

the bbc's paul reynolds says the london conference will be a limited measure to shore up the leadership of mahmoud abbas, also known as abu mazen, who is expected to win the palestinian presidential election on 9 january. at a news conference following talks with mr blair, mr abbas said the british prime minister was ""in a unique position to help us progress in our peaceful pursuit"". he added: ""your endeavour to hold a conference in london is another example of your deep commitment to this purpose."" in an interview with the bbc's political editor andrew marr, mr blair said getting progress between israelis and palestinians would be ""tough, but at least we have got the first step"". mr blair acknowledged some people believed he was too close to the israelis, but said the israelis were entitled to expect palestinians to give up terrorism. he argued that mr sharon was committed to the internationally-agreed roadmap peace plan and said his bid to disengage from gaza had to be part of the peace process, not the end of it. earlier, mr sharon again said he had not seen ""the slightest step"" the palestinians were working to end terror attacks - though he acknowledged palestinian leaders were in the middle of an election campaign that could be hampering their efforts. before visiting israel, mr blair made a surprise visit to iraq, where he met leaders in baghdad during his first trip to the city. he was briefed on preparations for the national poll, which is scheduled for next month but is threatened by a deadly campaign of insurgent violence. he also flew to basra in southern iraq where british forces are stationed.

153,"labour targets 'hardcore truants'

a fresh crackdown on persistent truants in england has been launched by education secretary ruth kelly.

serial truants make up one in 13 pupils. previous initiatives brought 40,000 pupils back to school since 1997, according to official statistics. parenting contracts, penalty notices and ""fast track"" prosecution systems have been used to tackle what has been a stubborn problem. it is thought that nearly half a million children skip school each day. tories say labour's previous success regarding the issue came because it tackled the easy part of the problem by reducing authorised absence, where parents are permitted to take children out of school. such absences are often due to family holidays.

however, serial truants avoid the classroom despite government schemes costing â£885m. those missing classes are more likely to become involved in crime as well as failing academically. measures such as parenting contracts and penalty notices were adopted by most local education authorities last term and come into force in the remainder this term. in one local education authority alone 800 parents were warned they would receive a penalty notice unless their child's attendance improved. the tough stance paid off with just 24 issued, while attendance improved in 776 cases. truancy has been reduced by 5% at the 128 worst hit schools through the government's behaviour improvement programme. this is the equivalent of 200 pupils back in classes since september.

the new measures come on top of national truancy sweeps - the sixth of which will take place on monday. police and education welfare officers patrol problem hotspots picking up truants and returning them to school. held twice each year, in addition to routine local patrols, previous country-wide sweeps have apprehended 31,000 pupils dodging school. in almost 14,000 of those cases, the youngsters were accompanied by their parents. a department for education and skills source said: ""every day in school counts. ""it is clear form these figures that schools and local education authorities are now seizing the tools we have given them to improve school attendance and crack down hard on the very small numbers of pupils which account for almost half of the nation's truancy.""

433,"connors boost for british tennis

former world number one jimmy connors is planning a long-term relationship with the lawn tennis association to help unearth the next tim henman.

the american spent three days at the lta's annual elite performance winter camp in la manga earlier this week. ""britain has the right attitude,"" said connors. ""the more involved i can be with the lta, the better. ""a short-term arrangement is just confusing. the kids will ask: 'what am i doing there?'"" lta chief executive, john crowther, added: ""the relationship that jimmy's already started to develop with the coaches and the players has said to us that we'd like some more of it. ""we want to use jimmy for a number of weeks a year and we hope this is the beginning of a good long-term relationship.""

the camp played host to more than 30 leading senior and junior players, including greg rusedski, arvind parmar and anne keothavong. ""la manga is an amazing site to take a bunch of kids who want to be the best,"" said connors, speaking at queen's club in london. ""what impressed me most was not only the coaches but the way the kids went about their workouts and the feeling they put into every practice they had. ""it was interesting to me to see kids of 15, 16, 17, with that desire and passion, and that can only be brought about by the coaches surrounding them. ""instilling the importance of work and practice is something you can't buy. ""they know what's been given to them and all they have to do is give back the effort, and every minute of practice they were doing that.""

speaking from la manga, lta performance director david felgate told bbc sport: ""jimmy was fantastic with the players and the coaches, and very humble considering what he's achieved. ""he worked through the coaches and hopefully it will grow and he'll get to have more of an individual relationship with some of the players and get to know them. ""he made it clear from the word go he didn't want it to be short-term. this is a 52-week-a-year job for me, it's my life and my passion and it's the same with the coaches. ""he respects that but he wants to be involved and have real input. and why would he stake his reputation on something that's not going to be successful?"" connors has also agreed to commentate for the bbc at next year's wimbledon championships. he will work during the second week of the tournament.

1578,"aviator 'creator' in oscars snub

the man who said he got oscar-nominated movie the aviator off the ground and signed up leonardo dicaprio has been shut out of the academy awards race.

charles evans jr battled over his role with the people who eventually made the film, and won a producer's credit. but he is not on the list of producers who can win a best film oscar due to a limit on the number of nominees. the oscars organisers have picked two of the aviator's four producers to be nominated for best film.

up to three producers can be named per film but the studios behind the aviator and million dollar baby failed to trim their credits - so the academy of motion pictures arts and sciences (ampas) has done it for them. the aviator's nominated producers are michael mann and graham king - with mr evans and sandy climan, mr mann's former deputy, left off. mr evans sued mr mann in 2001, claiming he came up with the idea, spent years developing it and persuaded dicaprio to play hughes - but said he was later excluded from the project. the two sides settled out of court in a deal that has remained secret apart from the fact mr evans' name has appeared as a producer when the film's credits roll. at the golden globes, mr evans - who was named among the winners when the film won best drama film - evaded a security guard to have his photo taken with dicaprio, director martin scorsese, mr mann and mr king.

ampas decided to limit the number of producers who could be nominated after shakespeare in love's victory in 1999 saw five producers collect awards. the eligible names for the aviator and million dollar baby were decided by ampas' producers branch executive committee on wednesday. the decision also saw clint eastwood get his third personal nomination for million dollar baby. he is now named in the best film category as well as being nominated for best director and best lead actor. the academy awards ceremony will be held in hollywood on 27 february. chinese actress ziyi zhang, star of crouching tiger, hidden dragon, hero and house of flying daggers, is the latest name to be added to the list of presenters on the night.

358,"eu rules 'won't stop uk spending'

the shape of the uk's economy in graphics

but he denied that he was ruling out british membership of the euro despite saying there would be no assessment of the five economic tests this year. mr brown said that it was vital the uk continued to invest in infrastructure, science, and education in the future. otherwise it would be overtaken by the likes of china, he told mps.

the chancellor said that the eu's planned changes in the growth and stability pact - designed to ensure that countries in the euro zone do not borrow too much - would force britain to run a budget surplus of 1% over the economic cycle.

under mr brown's rules, the uk current budget must be in balance over the economic cycle, but public investment is not counted as part of that deficit. he told the house of commons treasury select committee that the eu rules ""make it difficult for a low debt country to run the investment programmes that are necessary to improve its infrastructure"". but he argued that the eu was moving in the direction of the uk principles, and would eventually recognise the need to consider budget deficits over a longer period than one year, to include investment, and to take more account of the total size of government debt as well as the balance each year. under mr brown's ""sustainable investment"" rule, government debt should be under 40% - in contrast to the 60% allowed under the growth and stability pact.

mr brown vigorously denied conservative claims that he had in effect fiddled the figures to ensure that he met his own fiscal rules. in march the office of national statistics (ons) reclassified â£3.4bn of spending on road repairs as public investment - shortly before the chancellor announced in the budget that he would meet his own fiscal budget rule by only â£6bn. conservative michael fallon asked mr brown whether the treasury had leaned on ons to make this change, and said that the ons had received a written paper from the treasury on this matter. but the chancellor said mr fallon was ""impugning the integrity"" of the office of national statistics and said the decision had been made completely independently. mr brown also denied that he was increasing taxes to fund his spending gap. he told the treasury select committee that a growing economy meant more people in work and more profits for companies which would boost treasury coffers.

earlier, ex-conservative chancellor ken clarke welcomed a relaxation of the rules governing the euro zone. speaking on radio 4's today programme, mr clarke said political give and take would replace more ""rigid"" rules. but fellow tory david heathcoat-amory said the folly of the system was in trying to run europe's varied economies on one set of rules. ""the essential point here is that the stability and growth pact has turned out to be a fake,"" he said. ""the warning is about the european constitution, which we are going to have a vote on in a year or two, and that centralises and entrenches these rules in a constitution. it gives more powers to brussels to co-ordinate things like employment and economic policy."" but, speaking to the treasury select committee, gordon brown said that the new stability pact rules were not part of a binding treaty and could be changed again the future - potentially opening the way for future euro membership. ""the conditions for euro entry are unchanged by this new decision about the stability and growth pact,"" mr. brown said.

2063,"us airways staff agree to pay cut

a union representing 5,200 flight attendants at bankrupt us airways have agreed to a new contract that cuts pay by nearly 10%.

the deal will help the carrier, trying to survive by cutting costs by nearly $1bn (â£530m) a year, save about $94m. more than two thirds of its 28,000 staff have now accepted wage cuts. but talks are still continuing with a union representing mechanics, baggage handlers and cleaners, which has so far failed to negotiate a new contract. the seventh largest carrier in the us sought bankruptcy protection for a second time in two years last september. it had been one of the quickest to deal with difficulties faced by the aviation industry after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. but it emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy in march 2003 to face competition from low-cost carriers and higher fuel costs. us airways management has said it may need to start liquidating assets if it does not receive concessions from all staff by the middle of this month.

1168,"search wars hit desktop pcs

another front in the on-going battle between microsoft and google is about to be opened.

by the end of 2004 microsoft aims to launch search software to find any kind of file on a pc hard drive. the move is in answer to google's release of its own search tool that catalogues data on desktop pcs. the desktop search market is becoming increasingly crowded as google, aol, yahoo and many smaller firms tout programs that help people find files.

microsoft made the announcement about its forthcoming search software during a call to financial analysts to talk about its first quarter results. john connors, microsoft's chief financial officer said a test version of its desktop search software should be available for download by the end of the year.

""we're going to have a heck of a great race in search between google, microsoft and yahoo,"" he said. ""it's going to be really fun to follow."" microsoft is coming late to the desktop search arena and its software will have to compare favourably with programs from a large number of rivals, many of which have fiercely dedicated populations of users. the program could be based on the software microsoft owns as a result of its purchase of lookout software in early october. on 14 october google released desktop search software that catalogues all the files on a pc and lets users use one tool to find e-mail messages, spreadsheets, text files and presentations. the software will also find webpages and messages sent via aol instant messenger.

many other firms have released desktop search systems recently too. companies such as blinkx, copernic, enfish x1 technologies and x-friend all do the same job of cataloguing the huge amounts of information that people increasingly store on their desktop or home computer.

apple has also debuted a similar search system for its computers called spotlight that is due to debut with the release of the tiger operating system. due to follow are net giants aol and yahoo. the latter recently bought stata labs to get its hands on search software that people can use. microsoft is also reputedly working on a novel search system for the next version of windows (codenamed longhorn). however this is not likely to appear until 2006. ""the recent activity in the search industry shows that there is a need to move beyond simple keyword-based web search,"" said kathy rittweger, co-founder of blinkx. ""finding information of our own computers is becoming as difficult as it is to find the relevant webpage amongst the billions that exist.""

desktop search has become important for several reasons. according to research by message analysts the radicati group up to 45% of the information critical to keeping many businesses running sits in e-mail messages and attachments. jf sullivan, spokesman for e-mail software firm sendmail said many organisations were starting to realise how important messaging was to their organisation and the way the work. ""the key thing is being able to manage all this information,"" he said. also search is increasingly key to the way that people get around the internet. many people use a search engine as the first page they go to when getting on the net. many others use desktop toolbars that let them search for information no matter what other program they are using. having a tool on a desktop can be a lucrative way to control where people go online. for companies such as google which relies on revenue from adverts this knowledge about what people are looking for is worth huge amounts of money. but this invasiveness has already led some to ask about the privacy implications of such tools.

2107,"fresh hope after argentine crisis

three years after argentina was hit by a deadly economic crisis, there is fresh hope.

the country's economy is set to grow about 8% this year after seeing 9% growth last year, a sharp turnaround from 2002 when output fell 11%. the unemployment rate is improving, too: it is set to slip below 13% by the end of the year, down from 20% in may 2002. true, problems remain, but the overall picture is one of vast improvement. even the international monetary fund (imf) admits this. ""the argentine authorities are proud, should be proud, of the strong performance of the economy,"" thomas dawson, an imf director, said earlier this month.

argentina has made a remarkable recovery from a hideous and lengthy recession which in 2001 culminated in the government halting debt repayments to its private creditors. the debt default sparked a deep and prolonged economic crisis which, at least initially, was made worse by the government's decisions. pension payments were halted and bank accounts frozen as part of austerity measures introduced by the government to deal with the country's massive debts. in response, angry crowds of ordinary argentines took to the streets where dozens of lives were lost in clashes with the police. two presidents and at least three finance minister resigned in less than a month. argentina was on the brink of collapse. the fix was found in the currency markets with the abandonment of the peso's decade-long peg to the us dollar in february 2002. the subsequent devaluation saw thousands of people's life savings disappear. scathes of companies went bust. ""three years ago, every sector [of the economy] was hit by the crisis,"" said entrepreneur drayton valentine. it really was dire.

but since then, the general mood on the ground has improved dramatically, in part because the devaluation helped attract fresh direct investment from abroad and stimulate business within brazil. ""agriculture and tourism are helping,"" said entrepreneur drayton valentine.

mr valentine, who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina, was fortunate: at the time of the crisis, his savings were held in dollar accounts abroad. but now he is using his money to help with the start-up a trading company. he explained that initially, his firm is going to export building materials to spain and united states. then, he would like to diversify to other areas, depending on the market. ""locally there is a sense of recovery, many companies are exporting now,"" he said, noting that a lot of firms, which were closed during the crisis, are re-opening.

but not all that shines is gold. argentina is still burdened by its failure to pay private creditors at the end of 2001. president nestor kirchner's administration is still trying to hammer out an agreement with the creditors, but with the debts' nominal value standing at around $100bn it is not proving easy. debt defaults make further lending agreements both difficult and expensive to negotiate. argentina's current offer implies that the creditors would get just 25 cents for each dollar they are owed, according to the creditors. understandably, they want more and until they do, both they and others are loath to continue lending. for president kirchner, this proves a hopeless challenge. real losses have been suffered and somebody has to pay, observed jack boorman, adviser to imf's managing director, rodrigo rato. ""everyone needs to keep in mind the enormous cost on the part of both creditors and the argentine society and people that will have been endured by the time a settlement is reached,"" he said. ""the cost is enormous, and continues to be paid, and will not be reversed by any restructuring.""

with the international negotiations being troubled, it is of little help to president kirchner that the domestic situation remains strained as well.

this is partly because there are still bank account holders who are waiting to recover some of their deposits. ""the situation is bad for those who had previously chosen to save in argentina, "" said carlos baez silva, president of aara, an association that represents bank account and bond holders. few people have recovered more than about half their savings, mr baez silva estimated, pointing out that many of the savers who have lost out are pensioners or others who once trusted the government, people who set aside money for the future in the belief that their investment would be safe. ""a lot of them invested in good faith,"" he said. ""the argentine state responded by taking most of their investments."" the affair has made mr baez silva disillusioned with the country's legal system. on occasion, the supreme court has ruled against the interests of the people he represents, he says, insisting that the system cannot be trusted. ""people have to deposit their money in the banks, not necessarily because they trust them but because crime is so high that people cannot have their money in their homes beneath their mattresses."" mr valentine, who was born in the united states but grew up in argentina, agreed. ""if i have to save pesos [the local currency] there is not much problem, but i will think twice before i deposit dollars in a bank"".

1007,"freeze on anti-spam campaign

a campaign by lycos europe to target spam-related websites appears to have been put on hold.

earlier this week the company released a screensaver that bombarded the sites with data to try to bump up the running costs of the websites. but the site hosting the screensaver now displays a pink graphic and the words ""stay tuned"". no one at lycos was available for comment on latest developments in its controversial anti-spam campaign.

lycos europe's ""make love not spam"" campaign was intended as a way for users to fight back against the mountain of junk mail flooding inboxes. people were encouraged to download the screensaver which, when their pc was idle, would then send lots of data to sites that peddle the goods and services mentioned in spam messages. lycos said the idea was to get the spam sites running at 95% capacity and generate big bandwidth bills for the spammers behind the sites. but the plan has proved controversial.

monitoring firm netcraft analysed response times for some of the sites targeted by the screensaver and found that a number were completely knocked offline.

the downing of the sites could dent lycos claims that what it is doing does not amount to a distributed denial of service attack. in such attacks thousands of computers bombard sites with data in an attempt to overwhelm them. laws in many countries do not explicitly outlaw such attacks but many nations are re-drafting computer use laws to make them specific offences. lycos europe now appears to have put the plan on hold. the site hosting the screensaver currently shows a holding page, with the words, ""stay tuned"". the numerical internet address of the site has also changed. this is likely to be in response to spammers who have reportedly redirected traffic from their sites back to the lycos screensaver site. the campaign has come under fire from some corners of the web. many discussion groups have said that it set a dangerous precedent and could incite vigilantism. ""attacking a spammer's website is like poking a grizzly bear sleeping in your back garden with a pointy stick,"" said graham cluley, senior technology consultant for sophos. ""not only is this screensaver similar in its approach to a potentially illegal distributed denial of service attack, but it also is in danger of turning innocent computer users into vigilantes, who may not be prepared for whatever retaliation the spammers care to dream up.""

187,"talks aim to avert pension strike

talks aimed at averting a series of national strikes over pensions reforms will take place this weekend.

five public sector unions will hold private talks with deputy prime minister john prescott at labour's spring conference in gateshead. they want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 march. however, all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said bbc labour affairs correspondent stephen cape. in four days, britain's biggest union unison will start balloting 800,000 local government workers on strikes. other public sector unions have pledged to follow. it is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.

the five unions meeting mr prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. this would allow months of tough negotiations to follow, said our correspondent. but a spokesman for mr prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in april. privately ministers believe this will be the ""less painful"" option, our correspondent added. the public and commercial services union (pcs) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. pcs leader mark serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. ""for a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,"" he said. ""if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. ""in the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable.""

unison's 800,000 workers, the transport and general workers' union's 70,000 and amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 march walkout. mr prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. it is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.

2109,"air passengers win new eu rights

air passengers who are unable to board their flights because of overbooking, cancellations or flight delays can now demand greater compensation.

new eu rules set compensation at between 250 euros (â£173) and 600 euros, depending on the length of the flight. the new rules will apply to all scheduled and charter flights, including budget airlines. airlines have attacked the legislation saying they could be forced to push prices higher to cover the extra cost. the european commission is facing two legal challenges - one from the european low-fare airlines association (elaa) and the other from the international air transport association (iata), which has attacked the package as a ""bad piece of legislation"". previously, passengers could claim between 150 euros and 300 euros if they had been stopped from boarding.

however, only scheduled flight operators were obliged to offer compensation in cases of overbooking and they did not have to offer compensation for flight cancellations.

the eu decided to increase passenger compensation in a bid to deter airlines from deliberately overbooking flights. overbooking can often lead to 'bumping' - when a passenger is moved to a later flight. when this happens against a passenger's will, airlines will now have to offer compensation. in addition, if a flight is cancelled or delayed for more than two hours through the fault of the airline, all passengers must be paid compensation.

however, airlines do not have to offer compensation if flights are cancelled or delayed due to ""extraordinary circumstances"". airlines fear that ""extraordinary circumstances"" may not include bad weather, security alerts or strikes - events which are outside of their control. all eu-based airlines and operators of flights which take off from the eu will have to adhere to the new compensation regime which came into force on thursday. low-cost airlines have criticised the new compensation levels, arguing that the pay-out could be worth more than the ticket. ""it's a preposterous piece of legislation, we among all airlines are fighting this,"" ryanair deputy chief executive michael cawley told radio 4's today programme.

the european regions airline association (eraa) claims that neither airlines nor consumers were consulted over the changes. andy clarke, eraa director of air transport, said that the ec advice misleads customers as it leads them to believe that airlines could be liable for payouts if flights are delayed because of bad weather.

ec spokeswoman marja quillinan-meiland conceded there were ""grey areas"" but said ""these are not as big as the airlines are making out"". in cases of dispute, national enforcement bodies would decide whether the passenger had a case, she said. new technology means it is easier for airlines to take off and land in bad weather, she added. the eraa's mr clarke also warned that while airlines would comply with the new rules, the extra costs would be passed onto passengers. ""we reckon it's going to cost european air passengers - not the airlines, the airlines have no money, it has to be paid by passengers - 1.5bn euros, that's over â£1bn a year loaded onto european passengers,"" mr clarke said. ""that's basically a transfer of money from passengers whose journeys are not disrupted to passengers whose journeys are disrupted.""

on wednesday, jacques barrot, vice president of the european commission and also commissioner for transport, said that the changes were necessary. ""the boom in air travel needs to be accompanied by proper protection of passengers' right."" ""this is a concrete example of how the union benefits people's daily lives,"" he added. the ec has launched an information campaign in airports and travel agencies to inform airline passengers of their new rights.

spurs boss martin jol said his team were ""robbed"" at manchester united after pedro mendes' shot clearly crossed the line but was not given.

""the referee is already wearing an earpiece so why can't we just stop the game and get the decision right,"" said jol after the 0-0 draw. ""but at the end of the day it's so obvious that pedro's shot was over the line it's incredible. ""we feel robbed but it's difficult for the linesman and referee to see it."" mendes shot from 50 yards and united goalkeeper roy carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear. jol added: ""we are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal. ""what really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a tv monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it.

""we didn't play particularly well but i am pleased - even now - with a point, although we should have had three."" mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay. he said: ""my reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. ""it was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - i've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. ""it's really, really over. what can you do but laugh about it? it's a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn't count. ""it's not every game you score from the halfway line."" manchester united manager sir alex ferguson sympathised with tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. ""i think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game,"" ferguson told mutv. ""what i was against originally was the time factor in video replays. ""but i read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.

""i think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. i think that would be an opening into a new area of football."" arsenal boss arsene wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology.

1133,"mobile tv tipped as one to watch

scandinavians and koreans, two of the most adventurous groups of mobile users, are betting on mobile tv.

anders igels, chief executive of nordic operator teliasonera, tipped it as the next big thing in mobile in a speech at the 3gsm world congress, a mobile trade fair, in cannes this week. nokia, the finnish handset maker, is planning a party in singapore this spring to launch its tv to mobile activities in the region. consultancy strategy analytics of boston estimates that mobile broadcast networks will have acquired around 51 million users worldwide by 2009, producing around $6.6bn (â£3.5bn) in revenue.

sk telecom of south korea, which is launching a tv to mobile service (via satellite) in may plans to charge a flat fee of $12 a month for its 12 channels of video and 12 channels of audio. it will be able to offer an additional two pay tv channels using conditional access technology. mr shin-bae kim, chief executive of sk telecom, also at 3gsm, said: ""we have plans to integrate tv with mobile internet services.

""this will enable viewers to access the mobile internet to get more information on adverts they see on tv."" there will be 12 handsets available for the launch of the korean service. lg electronics of south korea was demonstrating one at 3gsm that could display video at 30 frames a second. footage shown on the handset was clear and watchable. a speech on mobile tv by angel gambino of the bbc also drew a large crowd, suggesting that even those mobile operators and equipment vendors which are not particularly active in mobile tv yet are starting to look into it.

but all is not simple and straightforward in the mobile tv arena. there is a battle for supremacy between two competing standards: dvb-h for digital video broadcasting for handsets and dmb for digital multimedia broadcasting. dr chan yeob yeun, vice president and research fellow in charge of mobile tv at lg electronics, said: ""dmb offers twice the number of frames a minute as dvb-h and does not drain mobile batteries as quickly."" the japanese, koreans and ericsson of sweden are backing dmb.

2191,"china bans new tobacco factories

the world's biggest tobacco consumer, china, has said it will not allow any new tobacco factories to be built.

china already has more than enough cigarette-making capacity, according to a spokesman for the tobacco industry regulator quoted in china daily. the ban threatens to reignite tensions between the regulator and british american tobacco, which plans to become china's first foreign cigarette maker. a spokeswoman for bat declined to comment on the report.

""china won't allow any new tobacco factories to be built, including joint ventures"", said xing wangli, a spokesman for the state tobacco administration monopoly quoted in china daily. he also said that the state would retain its monopoly on cigarette distribution. china has 350 million smokers who consumer 1.7 trillion cigarettes a year. smoking is fashionable in china, where it is seen as an essential - and manly - sociable touch for some jobs, such as salesmen. more young, urban woman are taking up smoking too. in july 2004, bat announced it had won approval for to build a $1.5bn (â£800m) joint venture factory in china which would make it the first foreign cigarette maker to manufacture there.

the state tobacco monopoly administration said a week later that it had not approved the deal, leading to an embarrassing public row. bat told the bbc at that time that it had not negotiated with the stmc, and secured approval from ""the highest levels of government"". since then, the row has flared occasionally, most recently at a forum in november. bat consistently declines to comment. ""xing's statement comes as especially bad news for british american tobacco"", the china daily newspaper said of the latest development. the bat spokeswoman said: ""there is nothing for us to add...since our announcement in july last year. the central government of china is the authority that approved our strategic investment."" the decision to ban further tobacco factories does not apply to deals made before 2005, according to the french news agency afp. the joint venture factory was expected to take till 2006 to build. the bat spokeswoman would not comment on its progress. however, if the stma continues to take a tough stance, expansion opportunities could be limited.

china's tobacco market is increasingly valuable as anti-smoking campaigners target public smoking in the west. china daily said the market was currently enjoying steady growth, making more than 210bn yuan ($25.4bn) in pre-tax profits last year, almost double the figure in 2000. the paper made no mention of health concerns. the stma is trying to restructure the domestic tobacco industry, closing some factories, though such moves can be unpopular with local governments.

how many times have you wanted to have a camera to hand to catch an unexpected event that would make headlines?

with a modern mobile phone that has a camera built in, you no longer need to curse, you can capture the action as it happens. already on-the-spot snappers are helping newspapers add immediacy to their breaking news stories headlines, where professional photographers only arrive in time for the aftermath. celebrities might not welcome such a change because they may never be free of a new breed of mobile phone paparazzi making their lives a bit more difficult. already one tabloid newspaper in la is issuing photographers with camera phones to help them catch celebrities at play. it could be the start of a trend that only increases as higher resolution phone cameras become more widespread; as video phones catch on and millions of people start carrying the gadgets around.

only last week, the world media highlighted the killing of the dutch film maker theo van gogh, notorious after making a controversial film about islamic culture.

one day later de telegraaf, a daily amsterdam newspaper, became news on its own when it published a picture taken with a mobile phone of mr van gogh's body moments after he was killed. ""this picture was the story"", said de telegraaf's image editor, peter schoonen. other accounts of such picture phone users witnessing news events, include:


 - a flight from switzerland to the dominican republic which turned around after someone took a picture of a piece of metal falling from the plane as it took off from zurich (reported by the swiss daily le matin). 
 - two crooks who robbed a bank in denmark were snapped before they carried out the crime waiting for the doors of the building to be opened (reported by the danish regional paper aarhus stiftstidende). 
 

but this is not just about traditional media lending immediacy to their stories with content from ordinary people, it is also about first-hand journalism in the form of online diaries or weblogs.

it has been called ""open source news"" or even ""moblog journalism"" and it has flourished in the recent us election campaign. ""not many people walk around with their cameras, but they always have their mobile phones with them. if something happens, suddenly all these mobiles sort of appear from nowhere, and start taking pictures,"" said digital artist henry reichhold. he himself uses mobile phone pictures to create huge panoramic images of events and places. ""you see it in bars, you see it everywhere. it's a massive thing,"" mr reichhold told the bbc news website.

with some picture agencies already paying for exclusive phone pictures, especially of celebrities, there are also fears about the possible downside of this phenomenon.

it could become a nuisance for public figures as higher resolution picture phones hit the market, with five megapixel models already being launched in asia. already on us photojournal site, buzznet, there is a public album full of snaps of celebrities, many of which were taken with camera phones. tabloid newspapers in the uk and many monthly magazines invite readers to send in images of famous people they have seen and snapped. but there are other positive uses of picture mobile phones that may balance these uses. for instance, in alabama, in the us, camera phones will be used to take snaps at crime scenes involving children, and help the authorities to arrest and prosecute paedophiles. and in china's capital beijing, courts have adopted mobile phone photos as formal evidence. for henry reichhold, this is progress: ""that's the whole thing about the immediacy of the thing. i can see that happening a lot more.""

bill gates has opened the consumer electronics show (ces) in las vegas, saying that gadgets are working together more to help people manage multimedia content around the home and on the move.

mr gates made no announcement about the next generation xbox games console, which many gadget lovers had been hoping for. about 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet and runs from 6 to 9 january. the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition tvs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies will all be on show over the three days.

mr gates said that a lot of work had been done in the last year to sort out usability and compatibility issues between devices to make it easier to share content.

""we predicted at the beginning of the decade that the digital approach would be taken for granted - but there was a lot of work to do. ""what is fun is to come to the show and see what has been done. it is going even faster than we expected and we are excited about it."" he highlighted technology trends over the last year that had driven the need to make technology and transferring content across difference devices ""seamless"". ""gaming is becoming more of a social thing and all of the social genres will use this rich communications. ""and if we look at what has been going on with e-mail, instant messaging, blogging, entertainment - if we can make this seamless, we can create something quite phenomenal.""

mr gates said the pc, like microsoft's media centre, had a central role to play in how people would be making the most out of audio, video and images but it would not be the only device. ""it is the way all these devices work together which will make the difference,"" he said. he also cited the success of the microsoft xbox video game halo 2, released in november, which pushed xbox console sales past playstation in the last two months of 2004 for the first time in 2004. the game, which makes use of the xbox live online games service, has sold 6.23 million copies since its release. ""people are online and playing together and that really points to the future,"" he said. several partnerships with device and hardware manufacturers were highlighted during mr gates' speech, but there were few major groundbreaking new technology announcements. although most of these affected largely us consumers, the technologies highlighted the kind of trends to come. these included what mr gates called an ""ecosystem of technologies"", like sbc's iptv, a high-definition tv and digital video recorder that worked via broadband to give high-quality and fast tv. there were also other deals announced which meant that people could watch and control content over portable devices and mobile phones.

ces features several more key speeches from major technology players, such as intel and hewlett packard, as well as parallel conference sessions on gaming, storage, broadband and the future of digital music. about 50,000 new products will be unleashed at the tech-fest, which is the largest yet. consumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by ces organisers the cea on tuesday. the gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the us in 2004. that trend is predicted to continue with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005.

1281,"open source leaders slam patents

the war of words between microsoft and the open source movement heated up this week as linux founder linus torvalds led an attack on software patents.

in a panel discussion at a linux summit in california mr torvalds said software patents were a problem for the open source movement. mitchell kapor, chairman of the mozilla foundation, warned that microsoft could use patent lawsuits in the future. linux is a freely-available alternative to microsoft's windows. it relies on a community of programmers for its development and is based on open source principles, which allow others to use and modify it without having to pay licence fees. the attack on software patents comes at a time when ibm has made 500 of its patents freely available. other companies are expected to follow suit.

there are between 150,000 and 300,000 registered software patents in the us and open source developers argue that many should never have been granted. this is a view corroborated by the uk patent office. ""some of the patents have dubious validity and are being wielded by some big companies to force smaller companies to buy licenses in the knowledge that they can't afford to take them to court,"" said dr jeremy philpott of the uk patent office. some panel members are worried that microsoft would issue a series of patent lawsuits in the future. ""if totally pushed to the wall - because their business model no longer holds up in an era in which open source is an economically superior way to produce software...of course they're going to unleash the wmds,"" mr kapor is reported as saying. microsoft did not want to comment directly, referring the issue instead to trade body intellect, of which it is a member. ""as far as intellect is concerned, open source and patents have co-existed for many years without problems,"" said spokeswoman jill sutherland. ""the industry respects the open source movement and in fact many of the members we represent use the open source system to develop software,"" ""we think the important point to make is that companies should be able to choose between patents, copyrights and open source as to the treatment of their intellectual discoveries, and not be forced into using one or the other,"" she added.

1008,"ink helps drive democracy in asia

the kyrgyz republic, a small, mountainous state of the former soviet republic, is using invisible ink and ultraviolet readers in the country's elections as part of a drive to prevent multiple voting.

this new technology is causing both worries and guarded optimism among different sectors of the population. in an effort to live up to its reputation in the 1990s as ""an island of democracy"", the kyrgyz president, askar akaev, pushed through the law requiring the use of ink during the upcoming parliamentary and presidential elections. the us government agreed to fund all expenses associated with this decision.

the kyrgyz republic is seen by many experts as backsliding from the high point it reached in the mid-1990s with a hastily pushed through referendum in 2003, reducing the legislative branch to one chamber with 75 deputies. the use of ink is only one part of a general effort to show commitment towards more open elections - the german embassy, the soros foundation and the kyrgyz government have all contributed to purchase transparent ballot boxes.

the actual technology behind the ink is not that complicated. the ink is sprayed on a person's left thumb. it dries and is not visible under normal light.

however, the presence of ultraviolet light (of the kind used to verify money) causes the ink to glow with a neon yellow light. at the entrance to each polling station, one election official will scan voter's fingers with uv lamp before allowing them to enter, and every voter will have his/her left thumb sprayed with ink before receiving the ballot. if the ink shows under the uv light the voter will not be allowed to enter the polling station. likewise, any voter who refuses to be inked will not receive the ballot. these elections are assuming even greater significance because of two large factors - the upcoming parliamentary elections are a prelude to a potentially regime changing presidential election in the autumn as well as the echo of recent elections in other former soviet republics, notably ukraine and georgia. the use of ink has been controversial - especially among groups perceived to be pro-government.

widely circulated articles compared the use of ink to the rural practice of marking sheep - a still common metaphor in this primarily agricultural society.

the author of one such article began a petition drive against the use of the ink. the greatest part of the opposition to ink has often been sheer ignorance. local newspapers have carried stories that the ink is harmful, radioactive or even that the ultraviolet readers may cause health problems. others, such as the aggressively middle of the road, coalition of non-governmental organizations, have lauded the move as an important step forward. this type of ink has been used in many elections in the world, in countries as varied as serbia, south africa, indonesia and turkey. the other common type of ink in elections is indelible visible ink - but as the elections in afghanistan showed, improper use of this type of ink can cause additional problems. the use of ""invisible"" ink is not without its own problems. in most elections, numerous rumors have spread about it.

in serbia, for example, both christian and islamic leaders assured their populations that its use was not contrary to religion. other rumours are associated with how to remove the ink - various soft drinks, solvents and cleaning products are put forward. however, in reality, the ink is very effective at getting under the cuticle of the thumb and difficult to wash off. the ink stays on the finger for at least 72 hours and for up to a week. the use of ink and readers by itself is not a panacea for election ills. the passage of the inking law is, nevertheless, a clear step forward towards free and fair elections."" the country's widely watched parliamentary elections are scheduled for 27 february.

1094,"ban hits half-life 2 pirates hard

about 20,000 people have been banned from playing the half-life 2 game.

game maker valve shut down the online accounts of the players because it had evidence that their copy of the game had been obtained illegally. copies of half-life 2 had been circulating on file-sharing systems soon after it was officially released. experts said the success of the half-life 2 anti-piracy system might tempt other game makers into creating their own version.

half-life 2 was officially released on 16 november but before gamers could get to grips with the long-awaited title they were forced to authenticate their copy of the game online. authentication involved setting up an account with valve's gaming community system called steam and letting that check which copy of the game was being run.

in a statement detailing the banning of the accounts valve said this system helped identify who had got hold of pirated copies. ""the method used was extremely easy for valve to trace and confirm, and so there is no question that the accounts disabled were used to try and illegally obtain half-life 2,"" read the statement. valve spokesman doug lombardi said that the company had not yet released sales figures for the game and would not say what proportion of all steam players the 20,000 represented. one effect of steam's popularity has been to limit the copies of the game sold in shops and artificially depress the game's ranking in the top ten. even so the title debuted at no 3 in the uk charts. valve also said that a small number of accounts were closed because people were using stolen credit cards to buy copies of the game or were using stolen steam accounts. some of those who have been banned by the move protested their innocence in the online forums on the main steam site and said they were being punished for what other people did with their account.

some contributors to the forums wondered if the action might force more piracy as people tried to get hold of successive copies of the game to keep ahead of valve's anti-piracy actions.

in its statement valve also said that rumours that it distributed fake half-life 2 keys, copies of the game or instructions on how to hack the game, just to catch pirates and cheats were false. the company said: ""the hack came from the 'community' as do they all."" it added that most of those banned simply tried to use copies of half-life 2 circulating on file-swapping systems such as bit torrent rather than use hacks to get around the need for cd keys. rob fahey, editor of online news site gamesindustry.biz, said the mass banning showed off the power of the steam system. before now, he said, it has been hard for game makers to do anything about piracy once the game was being played. ""but with this, valve is taking really effective steps against people using illegitimate copies of half-life 2,"" he said. if steam proves effective at cutting the piracy of games to a minimum, said mr fahey, other game makers may be tempted to set up copycat systems. ""it's not hard to see a point in the near future when every publisher wants you to run an application on your system purely to allow you to play their games,"" he said. this could mean that computers get cluttered with poorly written steam-type systems that are used to batter people with adverts. unless game firms were careful, he said, they could face a backlash from consumers who soon get tired of maintaining different accounts for every game they play.

super size me director morgan spurlock has won the writers guild of america's award for documentary feature writing.

the oscar-nominated film followed spurlock as he ate only mcdonald's fast food for an entire month. spurlock was given the award at a special ceremony at the roosevelt hotel in hollywood on tuesday. organisers said the rising popularity of documentary films led them to honour a writer for a documentary screenplay for the first time.

producer brian grazer presented the award to spurlock and the film's backers, roadside attractions, samuel goldwyn films and showtime independent films. spurlock set out to discover the effect of living on nothing but mcdonald's for a month, upgrading to supersize portions when offered. the film followed his 25lb weight gain and the health effects on his body, including his liver and cholesterol levels. mcdonald's announced it was to scrap its ""supersized"" meals last year, but denied the move was as a result of the negative publicity created by spurlock's film. spurlock was given his award on the same day the european court of human rights ruled that two uk activists should have been given legal aid in their long fight against a mcdonald's libel action. helen steel and david morris, from north london, dubbed the ""mclibel two"", were found guilty in a 1990s trial of libelling the company in a leaflet they had been handing out at the end of the case the high court in london ruled mcdonald's had been libelled and awarded the company â£60,000 in damages, later reduced to â£40,000 on appeal. but he found the leaflet was true in some aspects.

while some regard it as an essential celebration of continental talent, others see it as an equally unmissable parade of the reasons some countries do not normally produce international stars. the 50th annual contest will be held in kiev, ukraine, in may, after ukrainian singer ruslana won last year. the 50th anniversary special will be held in denmark later this year because the danish broadcasting corporation came up with the idea for the all-time contest. a plan to hold it in london was scrapped because of problems finding a suitable venue. ireland has been the most successful country in the show's history with seven victories, followed by the uk, france and luxembourg with five each.

anglo-dutch food giant unilever will help the pharmaceutical firm develop the snacks containing hoodia extract. phytopharm shares jumped 10.7% on the news, with analysts saying sales of $600m (â£309m) a year were possible. the plant, licensed to phytopharm in 1997, has been used for thousands of years by the sans bushmen of the kalahari desert to stave off hunger. studies have reportedly shown the plant curbs appetite instead of reducing calorific intake like many existing products.

phytopharm will receive an initial fee of â£6.5m from unilever - out of a potential total of â£21m - as well as future royalties on product sales. under the deal, production of the hoodia cactus at phytopharm's nursery in south africa will also rise from eight million plants to potentially hundreds of millions, said phytopharm chief executive richard dixey. the firm had initially hoped to market a slimming drug from hoodia with pfizer. but the research collaboration came to an end in 2003. analysts said unilever could launch the new products in 2007.

591,"all black magic: new zealand rugby

playing colours:

all black

the haka and more!

the all blacks

charles john munro discovered rugby at london's christ college, and on his return to nelson he staged new zealand's first game. nelson town met nelson college on 14 may, 1870, the town triumphing by two goals to nil, instigating a game that would become a national obsession and come to dominate the country's sporting passions. the game appealed to the kiwi psyche and quickly spread, the native maoris finding a particular empathy with the sport's warrior ethos. in 1888 a british team led by ae stoddart toured new zealand and australia, and soon after a maori named joe warbrick and an english ex-pat called thomas eyton decided to gather a combined new zealand team.

twenty-two maori and four 'pakiha' formed the 'new zealand native team,' who played a total of 107 matches in new zealand, australia and the uk. the integration of white and maori was a reflecion of enlightened new zealand rugby and society, even if the british press were somewhat mystified by the pre-match tradition of the maori war dance, the haka! the other great symbol of new zealand rugby, the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast, was proposed by tom ellison at the first annual meeting of the new zealand rugby football union in 1893. new zealand played their first international against australia in 1903, the kiwis triumphing 22-3 in sydney, and the following year an official british touring team came to new zealand for the first time. the tourists had gone through australia undefeated but their captain, david revell bedell-sivright, created animosity in new zealand with his patronising attitude. the kiwis shocked the rugby world with a 9-3 triumph in wellington, sparking great celebrations across the country, but bedell-sivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the uk.

their opportunity to prove him wrong came in 1905 with the first official new zealand tour to europe. the tourists won their early games with a quick-thinking, inventive approach, but press criticism began to grow over their 2-3-2 scrum formation that left a 'roving' forward free to disrupt opposition attacks. the tactic was effective, two late tries seeing the kiwis to a 12-7 win over scotland, before ireland were despatched 15-0 in dublin. a huge crowd at crystal palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the haka - but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in a 15-0 hammering of england. new zealand headed to wales to meet a country in the midst of its first 'golden age,' and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides. an excellent try on the left wing by teddy morgan sealed a 3-0 win in a hard-fought encounter at cardiff arms park, but post-match talk was dominated by a bob deans try that was ruled out by scottish referee john dallas. dallas said that deans was tackled short, but the kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try - on his death-bed three years later he exclaimed: ""i did score that try in cardiff.""

four of the 1905 all blacks went over to the newly formed 'all golds' rugby league side soon after the tour, but new zealand were strong enough to crush an anglo-welsh touring team in 1908. the first south africa tour of new zealand in 1921 saw honours shared in a three-test series, starting the greatest rivalry in rugby - and the long-running controversy between the countries over the all blacks' inclusion of maori players. the awesome 1924-5 all black tourists became known as 'the invincibles' after winning all 30 of their games in france, britain and ireland, including a crushing 19-0 victory over wales at st helen's. despite their success, the all blacks' 2-3-2 scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times, and the flaws were exploited by the springboks in south africa in 1928. employing the modern 3-4-1 scrum line-up against the new zealand 'rover' system for the first time, south african teams defeated the all blacks in five games and the test series was drawn two-all. the controversial new zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the 1930 lions tour (a series won 3-1 by new zealand), the lions manager describing the tactic as 'cheating,' prompting the international rugby board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum.

the all blacks' 1935 european tour started inauspiciously with an 11-3 loss to a swansea side inspired by teenage, schoolboy half-backs hayden tanner and willie davies. a thrilling test at cardiff arms park went to wales 13-12, although the winning try from geoffrey rees-jones was controversial following an illegal claude davey tackle in the build-up. new zealand's next visit to wales in 1953 proved difficult as they lost 8-3 to cardiff and drew 6-6 at swansea. the all blacks were on top in the test with wales at the arms park, but the teams were locked at 8-8 when a clem thomas cross kick was gathered by ken jones for a famous, match-winning try. the tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations, before a 19-5 success over the barbarians in an arms park thriller. new zealand built from that tour, and by the time they returned in 1963-4 they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world.

that made the shock all the greater when a drop goal by student john uzzell gave newport an unlikely 3-0 win over the tourists at rodney parade. wilson whinneray's side rallied to beat wales 6-0, their first win at the arms park in four attempts, and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour, but when they returned home the first question put to them was: ""what happened in newport?"" the only blemish on the record of the awesome 1967 tourists was a draw with east wales, as they beat the full wales team 13-6 in cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time. that lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in new zealand in 1969, the first time wales had toured the country as an independent team.

a ferocious game at the arms park in 1972 was edged 19-16 by the all blacks, a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on new zealand by the carwyn james-inspired lions of 1971.

james guided llanelli to a famous 9-3 win over the tourists at stradey park, though, and in the final game of the tour the barbarians defeated the all blacks 23-11 in cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played. new zealand defeated a wales xv 12-3 at the arms park in a non-cap game in 1974, but it was the 1978 game in cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries.

wales were leading 12-10 with one minute left when andy haden flew to the floor from a line-out. television pictures clearly showed that he dived, but english referee roger quittenton was fooled and awarded a penalty, duly converted by brian mckechnie for a 13-12 win. since that infamous game, the competition has largely left wales v new zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game. a crushing 23-3 win for new zealand in cardiff in the welsh rugby union's 1980 centenary game was a sign of things to come. the new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left europe behind was shown as the all blacks swatted wales aside 49-6 in brisbane in the semi-final of the inaugural world cup. the kiwis went on to claim the cup, and would inflict further misery on wales on their ill-fated 1988 tour of new zealand.

a young, talented wales side left britain full of confidence as triple crown winners, but one of the greatest ever new zealand teams demolished them 52-3 and 54-9. after also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games, wales captain jonathan davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game, but as his views were ignored he - along with a generation of wales' best players - chose to head north to rugby league.

a 34-9 win in cardiff followed for new zealand in 1989, and at the 1995 world cup wales' big talk was made to look embarrassing as the all blacks eased to victory in johannesburg. a crushing 42-7 kiwi triumph in wembley followed in 1997, and as wales' misery increased they turned to new zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches graham henry and steve hansen. there was a temporary resurgence in the welsh game, but when an experimental new zealand side came to cardiff's new millennium stadium in 2002 they left with a 43-17 victory.

a bruising 55-3 defeat followed for wales in hamilton in 2003 as hansen built towards the world cup, but in australia it was a remarkable performance against the all blacks that gave his side renewed hope. wales were given no chance going into the game, but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead 37-33 early in the second half. new zealand rallied to a 53-37 win, but the style shown by wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future. they now face an all blacks team led by henry and hansen, coming to europe with a weakened squad at the end of a long season. an encouraging display against south africa has inspired a confident wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over 50 years. they have a chance, but clearly history is not on their side.

114,"blair sees greater bush consensus

george w bush will display a more consensual approach to world politics as he begins his second term as us president, tony blair has said.

the prime minister said mr bush had learned military force was not the only way to fight terrorism. he understood that ""the best prospect of peaceful co-existence lies in the spread of democracy and human rights"", mr blair told the guardian newspaper. mr bush was sworn in at a ceremony in washington dc on thursday.

echoing the new us secretary of state condoleezza rice, the prime minister said there has been a clear evolution of us policy since the war in afghanistan in 2001. mr blair had personally seen the change over time in conversations with mr bush. the president understood that while military and security measures were important, there also needed to be a multilateral approach to solving the world's problems.

turning to critics' fears that the us was poised for further military action, mr blair refused to give succour to suggestions it was preparing for strikes against iran. the prime minister conceded that the us had ""what appears to be a harder position"" towards the state than europe. but the prime minister pointed out that until now the us had allowed britain, france and germany to take the lead in trying to halt the iranian nuclear programme. following claims that us forces had worked inside iran to identify potential targets, mr blair was asked if the sas had also been in the country. ""we never answer questions about special forces, but do not take that as indicating an affirmative,"" said mr blair.

mr blair said he believed the president was keen to work with other countries while trying to spread democracy and human rights. ""it is significant, in my view, that he is coming to europe as his first foreign visit,"" said mr blair. following his inauguration, mr bush is due in europe at the end of january.

186,"howard denies split over id cards

michael howard has denied his shadow cabinet was split over its decision to back controversial labour plans to introduce id cards.

the tory leader said his front bench team had reached a ""collective view"" after holding a ""good discussion"", but admitted it was ""not an easy issue"". he had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. the lib dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next monday.

tory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the id card scheme. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis, oliver letwin and tim yeo. but mr howard denied mr yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans ""stink"". he also said he was confident shadow home secretary mr davis would ""set out the position very clearly"" when he stands up to debate the matter next week. mr howard said the police had said id cards could ""help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives"". he added: ""when the police say that you have to take them seriously"".

he acknowledged there were ""good libertarian arguments"" against the cards, but said the shadow cabinet had weighed up all the ""conflicting interests"" before reaching its decision. ""i don't pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken."" he also denied he was afraid of looking ""soft"" on the issue, compared to labour. the conservatives announced their support for the government plans on monday evening.

sources within the party told the bbc mr howard had always been in favour of id cards, and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. but the tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.

they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would be able to deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. ""it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,"" a spokesman said. lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten has branded the id scheme a waste of money and ""deeply flawed"". he said: ""this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues' concerns over id cards.""

the chairman of the bar council, guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the ""margins of society"" would be driven into the hands of extremists. ""what is going to happen to young asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? they are going to be stopped. if they haven't [id cards] they are going to be detained."" tory ex-minister douglas hogg said he opposed the plans for id cards branding them a ""regressive"" step which would intrude into the lives of ordinary citizens without any counterbalancing benefits. he predicted ultimately carrying the cards would become compulsory and that would lead to large numbers of britain's ethnic minorities being stopped by police.

303,"election 'could be terror target'

terrorists might try to target the uk in the run-up to the election, london's most senior police officer has said.

sir ian blair said terror groups would remember the effect of the madrid bomb on spain's general election last year. other potential targets were the royal wedding and the uk's presidency of the european union and g8, he said. he refused to say if there was specific information about the risk of a pre-poll attack. no 10 was similarly cautious but said the threat was real.

the comments come after tony blair defended his controversial anti-terror proposals, warning that it would be wrong to wait for an attack before acting. sir ian told a meeting of the metropolitan police authority it would be ""unwise"" to speculate about whether there was specific information about risks of a pre-election attack. but he said: ""terrorists have long memories. they understand what happened in madrid and know what the impact of that was on the spanish electorate.

""this year we are responsible for the eu presidency, presidency of the g8, a royal wedding and a general election. ""there are obvious and enormous targets which we have to deal with."" sir ian said the debate over anti-terror plans was one for politicians, not the police, who would enforce any new powers.

home secretary charles clarke has also warned that a madrid-style pre-election bombing could happen in the uk too. asked about sir ian's comments, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""we believe the threat is real."" the spokesman declined to comment on whether the security services had received specific intelligence relating to a possible attack during the election campaign. he said no 10 did not disclose any security advice they received. earlier, writing in the daily telegraph, the prime minister conceded that plans to detain suspects under house arrest without trial were ""difficult issues for any government"". the commons has approved the measures despite considerable opposition, with the government's majority more than halved as 32 labour rebels joined tory and lib dem opposition. but mr blair insisted: ""there is no greater civil liberty than to live free from terrorist attack.""

tory leader michael howard has accused mr blair of steamrolling the house arrest plans and of ""using national security for political point scoring"". liberal democrat leader charles kennedy says that the plan is a further example of labour's ""authoritarian"" response to crises. the prevention of terrorism bill proposes ""control orders"", which as well as house arrest could impose curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. they would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against. but critics are concerned that it would be the home secretary and not judges who decided to impose control orders. the plans face further commons scrutiny on monday before passing to the lords.

1083,"security scares spark browser fix

microsoft is working on a new version of its internet explorer web browser.

the revamp has been prompted by microsoft's growing concern with security as well as increased competition from rival browsers. microsoft said the new version will be far less vulnerable to the bugs that make its current browser a favourite of tech-savvy criminals. test versions of the new program, called ie 7, are due to be released by the summer.

the announcement about internet explorer was made by bill gates, microsoft chairman and chief software architect, during a keynote speech at the rsa security conference currently being held in san francisco. although details were scant, mr gates, said ie7 would include new protections against viruses, spyware and phishing scams. this last category of threats involves criminals setting up spoof websites that look identical to those of banks and try to trick people into handing over login and account information.

in a bid to shore up the poor security in ie 6, microsoft has regularly issued updates to patch loopholes exploited by criminals and the makers of nuisance programs such as spyware. earlier this month it released a security bulletin that patched eight critical security holes - some of which were found in the ie browser. microsoft has also made a series of acquisitions of small firms that specialise in computer security. one of the first fruits of these acquisitions appeared last month with the release of a microsoft anti-spyware program. an own-brand anti-virus program is due to follow by the end of 2005. the decision to make internet explorer 7 is widely seen as a u-turn because, before now, microsoft said it had no need to update the browser. typically new versions of its browser appear with successive versions of the windows operating system. a new version of ie was widely expected to debut with the next version of windows, codenamed longhorn, which is due to appear in 2006. the current version of internet explorer is four years old, and is widely seen as falling behind rivals such as firefox and opera. there are also persistent rumours that search engine google is poised to produce its own brand browser based on firefox. in particular the firefox browser has been winning fans and users since its first full version was released in november 2004. estimates of how many users firefox has won over vary widely. according to market statistics gathered by websidestory, firefox's market share is now about 5% of all users. however, other browser stat gatherers say the figure is closer to 15%. some technical websites report that a majority of their visitors use the firefox browser. internet explorer still dominates with a share of about 90% but this is down from a peak of almost 96% in mid-2004.

827,"henman to face saulnier test

british number one tim henman will face france's cyril saulnier in the first round of next week's australian open.

greg rusedski, the british number two, is in the same quarter of the draw and could face andy roddick in the second round if he beats swede jonas bjorkman. local favourite lleyton hewitt will meet france's arnaud clement, while defending champion and world number one roger federer faces fabrice santoro. women's top seed lindsay davenport drew spanish veteran conchita martinez.

henman came from two sets down to defeat saulnier in the first round of the french open last year, so he knows he faces a tough test in melbourne. the seventh seed, who has never gone beyond the quarter-finals in the year's first major and is lined up to meet roddick in the last eight, is looking forward to the match. ""he's tough player on any surface, he's got a lot of ability,"" he said. ""we had a really tight one in paris that went my way so i'm going to need to play well from the outset because he's a dangerous competitor."" switzerland's federer, seeded one, is the hot favourite having won three of the four grand slam titles in 2004. he has beaten santoro in five of their seven previous encounters, but is taking nothing for granted. ""it's a tricky match,"" federer said. ""i played him at the us open and won quite comfortably then. but you never know, if the rhythm is a bit off, he can keep you guessing and make it difficult. ""the most important thing, though, is to get used to playing five-set matches and winning them."" the 23-year-old could meet four-time champion andre agassi in the quarter-finals before meeting russian marat safin, the player he beat in last year's final.

eighth-seeded american agassi is set to play a qualifier in round one if he can shake off a hip injury which ruled him out of the kooyong classic. second seed andy roddick will open his campaign against irakli labadze of georgia. the american could meet rusedski in the second round, seventh seed henman in the quarter-finals and hewitt in the last four. hewitt is hoping to become the first australian man to win the event since mark edmondson in 1976. the 23-year-old has never been beyond round four in eight attempts at melbourne park but has at least secured the opposite half of the draw to federer, who beat him in the australian open, wimbledon and us open last year. safin, seeded four, opens his campaign against a qualifier with 16th seed tommy haas, the player he beat in the semi-finals in 2002, a possible fourth-round opponent.

in the women's draw, davenport could encounter eighth-seeded venus williams in the quarter-finals and third-ranked anastasia myskina, the french open champion, in the semi-finals. bronchitis ruled davenport, the 2000 australian open champion, out of her sydney quarter-final on thursday. venus williams, who lost to younger sister serena in the melbourne final two years ago, opens against eleni daniilidou of greece. serena williams, who won her fourth consecutive grand slam at the 2003 australian open, was drawn in the bottom quarter with second seed amelie mauresmo, a runner-up in 1999. serena will open against another frenchwoman camille pin, while mauresmo plays australia's samantha stosur. wimbledon champion maria sharapova, seeded fourth, drew a qualifier in the first round but could meet fellow russian svetlana kuznetsova, the us open winner, in the last eight

789,"connors' rallying cry for british tennis

""do you have it in your heart? how much guts do you have? how much do you hate to lose?""

these are the questions jimmy connors will be asking of britain's brightest tennis hopes in the months, and possibly years, to come. the american legend swept into london on thursday to announce a ""long-term"" relationship with the lawn tennis association after spending three days at the elite performance winter camp in la manga. and the man who epitomised the phrase 'will to win' before lleyton hewitt was even born is clear about the qualities he hopes to convey. ""you know, everybody hits the ball well and there's a very fine line between number one and number 100,"" said connors. ""i was that fine line for a long time. but if i can help, i want to be part of teaching kids how to win.""

connors is not the first great name to offer his services to the lta - his long-time rival john mcenroe has repeatedly done the same. but connors is at pains to point out that his interest goes well beyond any publicity stunt, and he gave a glowing recommendation to the work of lta performance director david felgate and his team. ""britain has a different attitude, the right attitude, in taking the game forward and finding the next wimbledon champion,"" said connors. ""that's something you don't find every day. everybody talks a good game but not everybody puts that into effect. ""the impression i came away with after just seeing david and the other coaches for three days was one like i've never seen before, especially over here. ""this is not going to happen overnight, there are no miracle workers, but you're going in the right direction."" the 52-year-old's enthusiasm for the work going on in this country is in marked contrast to his relationship with tennis officials back in america. ""i've had discussions with the usta (united states tennis association) over a number of years,"" he said. ""that's where it (my input) ended."" connors is a straight-talker and will be equally blunt and honest in his dealings with the lta and the cream of britain's young players. ""if they're chosen, they've got to produce,"" he said.

""if not, someone will come and take their place. there's only one number one spot and it's lonely up there, but it's got the best view."" in the year that has seen andrew murray emerge as britain's great new hope, connors rejected suggestions that the scot might be put under too much pressure too soon. ""tim henman has a whole country on his shoulder,"" said connors. ""i don't know that pressure, but if you like that it can be a certain push to get on to the next level. ""someone's going to have to come and take over from him (henman). if i was andrew murray, i'd embrace that. that's what we play for."" despite the emphasis on hard work, training and preparation, connors does admit that the desire required of a champion has to come from within. ""the passion i had, i don't know if you can find that,"" he admitted. ""i was also nuts. i say that because there was nothing better for me than to compete on the tennis court. ""it was the most important thing in the world for me, and to do that something's got to be not right with you. there was nothing better for me ever than to play tennis in front of 25,000 people. ""what i had when i played tennis is what i am. you have to have that, you can't be moulded.""

striker nicolas anelka reportedly wants to leave manchester city in search of champions league football.

anelka, 25, is in talks over a contract extension beyond 2007 with city but is believed to fear his career will go stale if he stays at the club. the news of the world reports that anelka told a french magazine: ""i either decide to win titles or to have an easy life. ""i think i will always choose football, if a great club makes me an offer."" he added: ""to win titles you need players who have the capability of doing so. if we stagnate between eighth and 15th place it's impossible to progress. ""if i am going to score goals and not win, there is a risk it is going to create a feeling of being fed up."" anelka has earned a reputation for being a difficult character to handle after spells at arsenal, real madrid and paris st germain and he feels that is now coming back to haunt him.

chancellor gordon brown will deliver his budget to the house of commons on 16 march, the treasury has announced.

the budget, likely to be the last before the general election, will be at 1230 gmt on that wednesday, just after prime minister's question time. the annual event is when the chancellor outlines the government's taxation and broader economic predictions. it is likely to set out much of the tax and spending battleground for the election, widely expected on 5 may.

next month's budget will be mr brown's eighth since labour came to power in 1997. if a may election is called, there could be as little as 18 days between the budget and the announcement of a date for the election. a shortened finance bill would have to be rushed through parliament with all-party support to allow the government to continue collecting revenue. the full finance bill, with the budget measures in it, would then be returned to the commons after the election, if labour secures another term in office. as mr brown announced the budget date in a short ministerial statement, accountancy firm ernst & young urged him to put politics aside and focus on the long-term requirements of the economy. ""in the budgets that were given immediately before the last six elections, taxes were cut by the incumbent chancellor and, in many cases, taxes were increased soon after the election result,"" said aidan o'carroll, e&y's uk head of tax.

the government should change the law to give more protection to employees who raise health and safety concerns about their workplaces, the tuc has said.

it said data from employment tribunals suggested 1,500 ""safety whistleblowers"" had lost their jobs since 1999. some firms found it cheaper to sack a worker than to improve buildings or change working conditions, it said. the health and safety executive said it was trying to get workers more involved in helping to make workplaces safer. the tuc figures were drawn from unfair dismissal cases at tribunals were health and safety were the main issue.

safety representatives were often ignored when raising concerns because there was no legal duty to respond, claimed the union organisation. general secretary brendan barber said: ""it shouldn't be a firing offence to object to unsafe work. ""workers should not be placed in the situation where they are forced to choose between risking their job or risking their personal health and safety."" mr barber, who said the ""problem is far worse than official statistics show"", called for a legal system that ""protects safety whistleblowers"". he added that workers who are not in a union, as well as casual and migrant workers, ""stand little chance of redress.""

rory o' neill, editor of union-backed hazards magazine, which conducted the research, said: ""giving union safety reps more rights in more workplaces is the ultimate win-win. ""death and injuries at work increased last year, for the second time since the turn of the century. ""it would be a fatal mistake not to take full advantage of the union safety effect."" the tuc has called on the government to appoint ""roving"" safety reps and to increase spending on health and safety work inspections. the health and safety executive had said that it had launched an initiative to make factories and offices safer, with more worker involvement.

1804,"yukos drops banks from court bid

russian oil company yukos has dropped the threat of legal action against five banks it had accused of involvement in the sale of its key yugansk unit.

state-owned rosneft bought the unit for $9.3bn (â£5bn) after yukos was forced to sell assets to meet a $27.5bn tax bill. yukos says the sale was illegal and is pursuing damages in a us court. its lawyers now accept abn amro, bnp paribas, calyon, jp morgan chase bank, and dresdner kleinwort wasserstein were not involved in the sale financing. however, yukos still has an outstanding complaint against deutsche bank, which it alleges to be the leader of a consortium that was behind a bid for yugansk by state gas monopoly gazprom. the company has also accused gazprom, the russian federation and two other russian firms.

gazprom had been expected to win the december auction, but ended up not bidding. yugansk was sold to a little-known shell company, which in turn was bought by rosneft. yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder mikhail khodorkovsky. the firm, whose finance chief is now based in the us, filed for bankruptcy in houston, texas, and sought a court injunction against the sale. but deutsche bank has suggested yukos artificially manufactured a legal case to stop the sale of its main asset. a hearing scheduled for february 16 and 17 will rule on whether the us court has jurisdiction in the case.

the first convictions for piracy over peer-to-peer networks have been handed down in the us.

new yorker william trowbridge and texan michael chicoine have pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software. the two men faced charges following raids in august on suspected pirates by the fbi. the pair face jail terms of up to five years and a $250,000 (â£130,000) fine.

in a statement the us department of justice said the two men operated the central hubs in a piracy community organised across the direct connect peer-to-peer network. the piracy group called itself the underground network and membership of it demanded that users share between one and 100 gigabytes of files. direct connect allows users to set themselves up as central servers that act as co-ordinating spots for sharers. users would swap files, such as films and music, by exchanging data over the network. during its investigation fbi agents reportedly downloaded 84 movies, 40 software programs, 13 games and 178 ""sound recordings"" from the five hubs that made up the larger piracy group. the raids were organised under the umbrella of operation digital gridlock which was aimed at fighting ""criminal copyright theft on peer-to-peer networks"". in total, six raids were carried out in august. five were on the homes of suspected copyright thieves and one on a net service firm. the department of justice said that both men pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit felony copyright infringement. they also pleaded guilty to acting for commercial advantage. the two men are due to be sentenced on 29 april.

1263,"dvd copy protection strengthened

dvds will be harder to copy thanks to new anti-piracy measures devised by copy protection firm macrovision.

the pirated dvd market is enormous because current copy protection was hacked more than five years ago. macrovision says its new ripguard technology will thwart most, but not all, of the current dvd ripping (copying) programs used to pirate dvds. ""ripguard is designed to... reduce dvd ripping and the resulting supply of illegal peer to peer,"" said the firm. macrovision said the new technology will work in ""nearly all"" current dvd players when applied to the discs, but it did not specify how many machines could have a problem with ripguard. some bbc news website users have expressed concerns that the new technology will mean that dvds will not work on pcs running the operating system linux. the new technology will be welcomed by hollywood film studios which are increasingly relying on revenue from dvd sales.

the film industry has stepped up efforts to fight dvd piracy in the last 12 months, taking legal action against websites which offer pirated copies of dvd movies for download.

""ultimately, we see ripguard dvd... evolving beyond anti-piracy, and towards enablement of legitimate online transactions, interoperability in tomorrow's digital home, and the upcoming high-definition formats,"" said steve weinstein, executive vice president and general manager of macrovision's entertainment technologies group. macrovision said ripguard would also prevent against ""rent, rip and return"" - where people would rent a dvd, copy it and then return the original. ripguard is expected to be rolled out on dvds from the middle of 2005, the company said. the new system works specifically to block most ripping programs - if used, those programs will now most likely crash, the company said. macrovision has said that rip guard can be updated if hackers find a way around the new anti-copying measures.

1162,"halo 2 heralds traffic explosion

the growing popularity of online gaming could spell problems for net service firms, warns network monitoring company sandvine.

it issued the warning following analysis which shows that traffic on the xbox game network increased fourfold on the launch day of halo 2. the 9 november traffic explosion has continued into december, said sandvine. service providers now need to make sure that their networks can cope with the increasing demands for bandwidth. as well as being a popular single-player title, halo 2 can be connected to microsoft's subscription-based broadband network, xbox live. gamers who want to play online can create their own clan, or team, and take on others to see how well they compare.

but the surge in numbers and huge demands for bandwidth should be a wake-up call to the industry which must ensure that their networks can cope with the increases in traffic, said sandvine's chief technology officer marc morin.

in a bid to cope and ease congestion, providers are increasingly making their networks intelligent, finding out who is using bandwidth and for what. it could become common to charge people for the amount of bandwidth they use. ""the explosion in xbox live traffic attributed to halo 2 should be seen as a clarion call,"" he said. ""isps need to enhance the broadband experience for these high-end users by prioritising or reserving bandwidth for games,"" he added.

one of the main factors that spoils online gaming is ""lag"" in which there is a noticeable delay between a gamer clicking on a mouse or keyboard and what happens in the online gaming world. gamers tend to migrate toward networks with the lowest ""lag"". analysing traffic will become increasingly important for service providers if they are to hold on to bandwidth-hungry gamers said lindsay schroth, an analyst with research firm the yankee group. ""in the competitive broadband environment, operators need to differentiate the way they offer access to services like live-play gaming,"" she said. in countries such as korea, which has high levels of fast net connections to homes, online gaming is hugely popular.

""what we learned at the weekend is what labour tactics are going to be and it's going to be fear and smear,"" he told bbc news. the tory co-chairman attacked labour's six new pledges as ""vacuous"" and said mr blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. dr fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid â£500,000 to former tory treasurer lord ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election.

one in 10 adult americans - equivalent to 22 million people - owns an mp3 player, according to a survey.

a study by the pew internet and american life project found that mp3 players are the gadget of choice among affluent young americans. the survey did not interview teenagers but it is likely that millions of under-18s also have mp3 players. the american love affair with digital music players has been made possible as more and more homes get broadband.

of the 22 million americans who own mp3 players, 59% are men compared to 41% of women. those on high income - judged to be $75,000 (â£39,000) or above - are four times more likely to have players than those earning less than $30, 000 ( â£15,000). broadband access plays a big part in ownership too. almost a quarter of those with broadband at home have players, compared to 9% of those who have dial-up access. mp3 players are still the gadget of choice for younger adults. almost one in five us citizens aged under 30 have one. this compares to 14% of those aged 30-39 and 14% of those aged 40-48. the influence of children also plays a part. sixteen percent of parents living with children under 18 have digital players compared to 9% of those who don't. the ease of use and growth of music available on the net are the main factors for the upsurge in ownership, the survey found. people are beginning to use them as instruments of social activity - sharing songs and taking part in podcasting - the survey found.

it could cost â£80m to run a uk referendum on the european constitution, ministers have revealed.

in a written parliamentary answer, constitutional affairs minister chris leslie said the poll was likely to cost the same as a general election. mr leslie said the cost could not be compared with the only previous british referendum, held 30 years ago. ministers say the constitution would make the european union work better but critics fear creating a ""super state"". labour mp john cryer, whose question revealed the price estimate, said the cost surprised him but was not a central factor as it was important people had their say. but he said it would have been better to have rejected the constitution so avoiding the need for a referendum. the 2001 election cost â£80m. no date for the vote has been set but foreign secretary jack straw has suggested it is unlikely to be held until early 2006 - after the predicted date for the next election. most voters said the uk should stay in the common market in the 1975 referendum.

1125,"broadband takes on tv viewing

the number of europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months, with the web eating into tv viewing habits, research suggests.

just over 54 million people are hooked up to the net via broadband, up from 34 million a year ago, according to market analysts nielsen/netratings. the total number of people online in europe has broken the 100 million mark. the popularity of the net has meant that many are turning away from tv, say analysts jupiter research. it found that a quarter of web users said they spent less time watching tv in favour of the net

the report by nielsen/netratings found that the number of people with fast internet access had risen by 60% over the past year.

the biggest jump was in italy, where it rose by 120%. britain was close behind, with broadband users almost doubling in a year. the growth has been fuelled by lower prices and a wider choice of always-on, fast-net subscription plans. ""twelve months ago high speed internet users made up just over one third of the audience in europe; now they are more than 50% and we expect this number to keep growing,"" said gabrielle prior, nielsen/netratings analyst. ""as the number of high-speed surfers grows, websites will need to adapt, update and enhance their content to retain their visitors and encourage new ones."" the total number of europeans online rose by 12% to 100 million over the past year, the report showed, with the biggest rise in france, italy, britain and germany.

the ability to browse web pages at high speed, download files such as music or films and play online games is changing what people do in their spare time.

a study by analysts jupiter research suggested that broadband was challenging television viewing habits. in homes with broadband, 40% said they were spending less time watching tv. the threat to tv was greatest in countries where broadband was on the up, in particular the uk, france and spain, said the report. it said tv companies faced a major long-term threat over the next five years, with broadband predicted to grow from 19% to 37% of households by 2009. ""year-on-year we are continuing to see a seismic shift in where, when and how europe's population consume media for information and entertainment and this has big implications for tv, newspaper and radio,"" said jupiter research analyst olivier beauvillian.

1234,"savvy searchers fail to spot ads

internet search engine users are an odd mix of naive and sophisticated, suggests a report into search habits.

the report by the us pew research center reveals that 87% of searchers usually find what they were looking for when using a search engine. it also shows that few can spot the difference between paid-for results and organic ones. the report reveals that 84% of net users say they regularly use google, ask jeeves, msn and yahoo when online.

almost 50% of those questioned said they would trust search engines much less, if they knew information about who paid for results was being hidden. according to figures gathered by the pew researchers the average users spends about 43 minutes per month carrying out 34 separate searches and looks at 1.9 webpages for each hunt. a significant chunk of net users, 36%, carry out a search at least weekly and 29% of those asked only look every few weeks. for 44% of those questioned, the information they are looking for is critical to what they are doing and is information they simply have to find.

search engine users also tend to be very loyal and once they have found a site they feel they can trust tend to stick with it. according to pew research 44% of searchers use just a single search engine, 48% use two or three and a small number, 7%, consult more than three sites. tony macklin, spokesman for ask jeeves, said the results reflected its own research which showed that people use different search engines because the way the sites gather information means they can provide different results for the same query. despite this liking for search sites half of those questioned said they could get the same information via other routes. a small number, 17%, said they wouldn't really miss search engines if they did not exist. the remaining 33% said they could not live without search sites. more than two-thirds of those questioned, 68%, said they thought that the results they were presented with were a fair and unbiased selection of the information on a topic that can be found on the net. alongside the growing sophistication of net users is a lack of awareness about paid-for results that many search engines provide alongside lists of websites found by indexing the web. of those asked, 62% were unaware that someone has paid for some of the results they see when they carry out a search. only 18% of all searchers say they can tell which results are paid for and which are not. said the pew report: ""this finding is ironic, since nearly half of all users say they would stop using search engines if they thought engines were not being clear about how they presented paid results."" commenting mr macklin said sponsored results must be clearly marked and though they might help with some queries user testing showed that people need to be able to spot the difference.

world number one roger federer added the dubai championship trophy to his long list of successes - but not before he was given a test by ivan ljubicic.

top seed federer looked to be on course for a easy victory when he thumped the eighth seed 6-1 in the first set. but ljubicic, who beat tim henman in the last eight, dug deep to secure the second set after a tense tiebreak. swiss star federer was not about to lose his cool, though, turning on the style to win the deciding set 6-3. the match was a re-run of last week's final at the world indoor tournament in rotterdam, where federer triumphed, but not until ljubicic had stretched him for five sets. ""i really wanted to get off to a good start this time, and i did, and i could really play with confidence while he still looking for his rhythm,"" federer said.

""that took me all the way through to 6-1 3-1 0-30 on his serve and i almost ran away with it. but he came back, and that was a good effort on his side."" ljubicic was at a loss to explain his poor showing in the first set. ""i didn't start badly, but then suddenly i felt like my racket was loose and the balls were flying a little bit too much. and with roger, if you relax for a second it just goes very quick,"" he said. ""after those first three games it was no match at all. i don't know, it was really weird. i was playing really well the whole year, and then suddenly i found myself in trouble just to put the ball in the court."" but despite his defeat, the world number 14 was pleased with his overall performance. ""i had a chance in the third, and for me it's really positive to twice in two weeks have a chance against roger to win the match.

353,"blair 'said he would stand down'

tony blair promised gordon brown he would stand down before the next election, a new book about the chancellor claims.

but the prime minister changed his mind following intervention from allies in the cabinet, according to the book. the book by sunday telegraph journalist robert peston said the pair had ""mutual animosity and contempt"" for each other. the book, brown's britain, said tony blair felt by november 2003 he had lost voters' trust.

the author's sources, all unnamed ""allies"" of mr blair and mr brown, said the prime minister felt the iraq war had undermined him and that he was no longer an asset to the labour party.

the book, serialised in the sunday telegraph, alleges that mr blair told the chancellor at a dinner hosted by deputy pm john prescott in november 2003 of his intention to stand down. ""at that stage he saw gordon brown and said, 'look you are the next most influential member of the government, i need your help to get through the next year,"" mr peston said. ""i myself recognise that i'm going to have to stand down before the election but help me to get through the year and i will then stand down.'"" but he changed his mind in june 2004, following intervention from allies in the cabinet and the suspicion that the chancellor was deliberately manoeuvring against him, the book claims.

mr peston told bbc news: ""my understanding is that they are not nearly as close or as friendly as they once were. ""what the book says is there now a pretty profound mutual mistrust, mutual animosity. ""i think in public you see this double act pretending everything is alright but in private i don't think the relationship is good because brown, understandably, feels deeply betrayed - particularly over this issue of the leadership."" there has been fresh speculation of a rift recently, following their separate responses to the asian tsunami. rumours of a rift were fuelled by the sudden decision to hold mr blair's monthly media conference at the same time as a long-planned speech by mr brown on uk plans to tackle global poverty with a new ""marshall plan"" for africa. there was speculation the pair were trying to outdo each other's response to the disaster.

former welfare minister frank field mp criticised the reported rivalry between the pair on gmtv's sunday programme.

""what sort of model does it give to the nation when the two most important political leaders do nothing but fight it out together or use their aides to fight it out?"" the labour mp for birkenhead asked. he said the prime minister should sack mr brown, but did not believe mr blair was strong enough to do so. conservative policy co-ordinator david cameron, mp for witney, added: ""if it wasn't so serious it would be funny. ""but it is serious - you've got the two most senior people in the government not concentrating on fighting crime, poverty or dirty hospitals - they are fighting each other."" carol walker, bbc news 24 political correspondent, added: ""there is a real concern that this could undermine the general election campaign. ""and clearly it is very bad news for the government at a time when it is trying to explain what it is doing to respond to the terrible problems thrown up by the tsunami disaster.""

1799,"yukos unit fetches $9bn at auction

a little-known russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant yukos at auction in moscow.

baikal finance group outbid favourite gazprom, the state-controlled gas monopoly, to buy yuganskneftegas. baikal paid 260.75bn roubles ($9.37bn: â£4.8bn) for yugansk - nowhere near the $27bn russia says yukos owes in taxes. yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and russian law, and said baikal had bought itself trouble.

""the company considers that the victor of today's auction has bought itself a serious $9bn headache,"" said yukos spokesman alexander shadrin. he said the company would continue to make ""every lawful move"" to protect tens of thousands of shareholders in yukos from ""this forcible and illegitimate removal of their property"". meanwhile, tim osborne, head of yukos main shareholders' group menatep, said that yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt, and that legal action would be taken, outside russia, against the auction winners. reports from russia say baikal has paid a deposit of nearly $1.7bn from a sberbank (savings bank) account to the russian federal property fund, for yugansk.

the sale came despite a restraining order issued by a us court dealing with the firm's bankruptcy application for chapter 11 protection. yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but russian authorities argued they were imposing the law, trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes. there were originally four registered bidders, and with its close ties to the kremlin, state-backed gas monopoly gazprom had been seen as favourite. but just two companies turned up for the auction, gazprom and the unknown baikal finance group, named after a large freshwater lake in siberia. and, according to tass news agency, gazprom did not make a single bid, leaving the way open for baikal, which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles.

mystery firm baikal finance group is officially registered in the central russian region of tver, but many analysts believe it may be linked to gazprom. kaha kiknavelidze, analyst at troika dialog, said: ""i think a decision that yugansk should end up with gazprom was taken a long time ago. so the main question was how to structure this transaction.

""i would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and gazprom now has a partner. ""i would also not exclude that baikal will decline to pay in 14 days, that are given by law, and gazprom is then recognised as the winner. this would give gazprom an extra 14 days to accumulate the needed funds. ""another surprise was that the winner paid a significant premium above the starting price."" however, gazprom has announced it is not linked to baikal in any way. and paul collison, chief analyst at brunswick ubs, said: ""i see no plausible explanation for the theory that baikal was representing competing interests. ""yugansk will most likely end up with gazprom but could still end up with the government. there is still potential for surprises."" yugansk is at the heart of yukos - pumping close to a million barrels of oil a day. the unit was seized by the government which claims the oil giant owes more than $27bn in taxes and fines. yukos says those tax demands are exorbitant, and had sought refuge in us courts.

the us bankruptcy court's initial order on thursday - to temporarily block the sale - in response to yukos filing for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, was upheld in a second ruling on saturday. the protection, if recognised by the russian authorities, would have allowed yukos' current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets. yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation - punishment for the political ambitions of its founder, mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky is now in jail, on separate fraud charges. but president vladimir putin has described the affair as a crackdown on corruption - and the bbc's sarah rainsford in moscow says most russians believe the destruction of yukos is now inevitable. hours before the auction lawyers for menatep, a group through which mr khodorkovsky and his associates control yukos, said they would take legal action in other countries. menatep lawyers, who were excluded from observing the auction, said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound russian oil and gas exports.

newcastle boss graeme souness has reopened his dispute with craig bellamy after claiming the welshman was ""not good enough"" for the magpies. bellamy left newcastle to join celtic on loan after a major row with souness. souness - who refused to refer to the 25-year-old by name - said bellamy did not score enough goals ""the chap that's just gone has scored 9.3 goals a season in his time in senior football - half of those weren't even in the top flight,"" said souness. ""that's not good enough for a striker at a club like this. ""we need to have two strikers who are near 20 goals on a regular basis.""

bellamy turned down a move to birmingham in favour of joining celtic after a disagreement about the welsh international playing out of position quickly escalated. earlier in the week, souness had said that he risked losing the confidence of the players and damaging his own reputation if he had not taken a hard line after bellamy accused him of lying.

""there are certain things you can forgive and forget,"" said souness. ""but if i'd been seen to be weak in this case there was no future for me with the players in the dressing room or any job i have after newcastle."" he could then return to st james' park - and he says that he wants to. however, it would seem unlikely he will play for newcastle again as long as souness remains in charge.

conductor marcello viotti, director of venice's famous la fenice theatre, has died in germany at 50.

viotti, director of la fenice since 2002, conducted at renowned opera houses worldwide including milan's la scala and the vienna state opera. his time at la fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. he fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for jules massenet's manon last week.

he conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the berlin philharmonic and the english chamber orchestra. viotti was born in switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the lausanne conservatory. his career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the gino marinuzzi conducting competition in italy. viotti established himself as chief conductor of the turin opera and went on to become chief conductor of munich's radio orchestra. at la fenice viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the french composer massenet's thais and some of his other productions included giuseppe verdi's la traviata and richard strauss's ariadne auf naxos.

the last opera he directed at la fenice was massenet's le roi de lahore. viotti's debut at the new york's metropolitan opera came in 2000 with giacomo puccini's madame butterfly, followed by la boheme, la traviata and fromental halevy's la juive. giampaolo vianello, superintendent of the fenice theatre foundation, said: ""i am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre."" viotti's last public performance was on 5 february when he conducted vincenzo bellini's norma at the vienna state opera.

eurosceptic party ukip have suspended a candidate for allegedly suggesting the criminally insane should be killed.

john houston, 54, was due to stand in the east kilbride seat in lanarkshire at the next election. but he was suspended after his reported views, including the return of the british empire, were sent to two scottish newspapers. ukip spokesman mark croucher said those who selected mr houston knew nothing of his views. the episode comes at a difficult time for ukip, soon after the high-profile departure of mep robert kilroy-silk. mr houston is alleged to have said that the organs of the criminally insane should be ""made available to law-abiding members of the community"" and proposed the legalisation of drugs and the sex trade. the document reportedly said: ""we're looking for the resurrection of the british empire. ""the problems for the human race - environmental and others - can only be dealt with on a global scale, and that calls for a radical alliance of the english-speaking nations, which they are uniquely able to do."" mr croucher said the main issue would be that mr houston's reported views had been presented as ukip policy, which they were not. he said they might have been submissions to a committee working on the party's manifesto, but would not have been matched to mr houston when he was standing to become a candidate. he told bbc news: ""he appears to have said these things. we have suspended him as a member and as a candidate. ""by all accounts none of this was mentioned at his selection meeting. ""it is simply a distraction from the task in hand, the eu constitution, not individual idiocies."" mr houston was quoted in the herald newspaper saying: ""i feel ukip have over-reacted and overshot the runway.""

peter nielson, who is ukip scotland chairman, said he had suspended mr houston on friday night. ""he will remain suspended while the matter is being investigated and then we will decide if and what further action will be taken."" he said that any evidence would be looked into and mr houston may be interviewed by the party. he added: ""i can't comment too much at the moment, i have one version from him but i haven't seen the papers yet.""

2045,"krispy kreme shares hit

shares in krispy kreme doughnuts have taken a dunking on wall street after the firm revealed it would have to restate its 2004 financial reports.

the company warned the move would cut its profits by $3.8m to $4.9m (â£2m to â£2.6m) - or between 6.6% and 8.6%. krispy kreme said accounting errors had forced the move, adding that its board of directors made the decision to restate its accounts on 28 december. however, the company was unavailable to comment on why it had delayed the news.

it also warned it might have to further restate results for 2004 and 2005.

shares in krispy kreme sank 14.87% - or $1.83 - to close at $10.48 on the news. the revelation comes just a month after the firm warned earnings would be cut by as much as 7.6% as a result of accounting errors. krispy kreme said the latest adjustments involved the way it accounted for the repurchase of three franchise restaurants. it added it would now be reviewing how it accounts for its leases. in a further blow, the firm said it had been advised that some of its franchise owners were not in compliance with their loan agreements, and warned it might need to borrow extra money if it was required to honour agreements on franchisee debts or operating leases.

krispy kreme added that it had enough cash to fund its current operations, but it could not borrow any more under its existing agreements.

the proportion of surfers using microsoft's internet explorer (ie) has dropped to below 90%, say web analysts.

net traffic monitor, onestat.com, has reported that the open-source browser firefox 1.0, released on 9 november, seems to be drawing users away from ie. while ie's market share has dropped 5% since may to 88.9%, mozilla browsers - including firefox - have grown by 5%. firefox is made by the mozilla foundation which was set up by former browser maker netscape in 1998. although there have been other preview versions of firefox, version 1.0 was the first complete official program. ""it seems that people are switching from microsoft's internet explorer to mozilla's new firefox browser,"" said niels brinkman, co-founder of amsterdam-based onestat.com.

mozilla browsers - including firefox 1.0 - now have 7.4% of the market share, the figures suggest. mozilla said that more than five million have downloaded the free software since its official release. supporters of the open-source software in the us managed to raise $250,000 (â£133,000) to advertise the release of firefox 1.0 in the new york times, and support the mozilla foundation. there was a flurry of downloads on its first day of release.

the figures echo similar research from net analyst websidestory which suggested that ie had 92.9% of users in october compared to 95.5% in june. microsoft ie has dominated the browser market for some time after taking the crown from netscape, and its share of users has always stayed at around the 95% mark. firefox is attractive to many because it is open-source. that means people are free to adapt the software's core code to create other innovative features, like add-ons or extensions to the program. fewer security holes have also been discovered so far in firefox than in ie. paul randle, microsoft windows client product manager, responded to the figures: ""we certainly respect that some customers will choose alternative browsers and that choosing a browser is about more than a handful of features. ""microsoft continues to make significant investments in ie, including service pack 2 with advanced security technologies, and continues to encourage a vibrant ecosystem of third party add-ons for internet explorer."" firefox wants to capture 10% of the market by the end of 2005. other browser software, like opera and apple's safari, are also challenging microsoft's grip on the browser market. opera is set to release its version 7.60 by the end of the year. onestat.com compiled the statistical measurements from two million net users in 100 countries.

she was born lilian alicia marks in london in 1910. her parents were comfortably off - her father, a mining engineer, drove a rolls royce. when she was eight, her mother took a decision which changed her life. fearing that she had flat feet and weak legs, she arranged for her to have ballet lessons. very quickly it became apparent that she was something special. she was spotted by the russian artistic impresario, sergei diaghilev, who wanted her to dance for his company, ballets russes. she became ill with diphtheria but kept in touch, and, eventually, with a governess in tow, joined diaghilev in monte carlo when she was 14.

from here, she toured europe, playing in all the top venues. it was diaghilev who changed her name without even consulting her. her life was one of great excitement. people such as matisse and stravinsky became like uncles to her, the latter put in charge of her musical education. soon after diaghilev's death in 1929, alicia markova returned to england and became britain's first international ballerina. she helped launch the ballet club at the mercury theatre (later the ballet rambert), the vic wells ballet, and then, with anton dolin, the markova-dolin ballet of 1935-37. she also began working with young choreographers such as anthony tudor and frederick ashton who became huge influences on the direction of ballet in the west.

her version of giselle, all lightness and grace, is still considered to be among the finest ever. she was also outstanding in the dying swan. she was one of the first british ballerinas to take a major part in les sylphides. she, above all, helped popularise ballet both in britain and in america.

alicia markova spent world war ii in the united states where, in a re-formed ballets russes, she played to huge audiences. she even appeared in hollywood movies. in 1950, back in england, she and anton dolin jointly established the festival ballet. she retired in 1963, an ""instant decision"" she said, ""largely because of a leg injury"". created a dame, she made a new career for herself as a teacher. she also travelled the world directing ballet companies and putting on shows. she became director of ballet for the metropolitan opera ballet in new york, and for some years was full-time professor of ballet and performing arts in the university of cincinnati. a critic once said of dame alicia markova's dancing: ""she gave the illusion of moving as if she had no weight to get off the ground.""

us president george w bush has pledged to introduce a ""tough"" federal budget next february in a bid to halve the country's deficit in five years.

the us budget and its trade deficit are both deep in the red, helping to push the dollar to lows against the euro and fuelling fears about the economy. mr bush indicated there would be ""strict discipline"" on non-defence spending in the budget. the vow to cut the deficit had been one of his re-election declarations. the federal budget deficit hit a record $412bn (â£211.6bn) in the 12 months to 30 september and $377bn in the previous year.

""we will submit a budget that fits the times,"" mr bush said. ""it will provide every tool and resource to the military, will protect the homeland, and meet other priorities of the government."" the us has said it is committed to a strong dollar. but the dollar's weakness has hit european and asian exporters and lead to calls for us intervention to boost the currency. mr bush, however, has said the best way to halt the dollar's slide is to deal with the us deficit.

1212,"china net cafe culture crackdown

chinese authorities closed 12,575 net cafes in the closing months of 2004, the country's government said.

according to the official news agency most of the net cafes were closed down because they were operating illegally. chinese net cafes operate under a set of strict guidelines and many of those most recently closed broke rules that limit how close they can be to schools. the move is the latest in a series of steps the chinese government has taken to crack down on what it considers to be immoral net use.

the official xinhua news agency said the crackdown was carried out to create a ""safer environment for young people in china"". rules introduced in 2002 demand that net cafes be at least 200 metres away from middle and elementary schools. the hours that children can use net cafes are also tightly regulated. china has long been worried that net cafes are an unhealthy influence on young people. the 12,575 cafes were shut in the three months from october to december. china also tries to dictate the types of computer games people can play to limit the amount of violence people are exposed to.

net cafes are hugely popular in china because the relatively high cost of computer hardware means that few people have pcs in their homes. this is not the first time that the chinese government has moved against net cafes that are not operating within its strict guidelines. all the 100,000 or so net cafes in the country are required to use software that controls what websites users can see. logs of sites people visit are also kept. laws on net cafe opening hours and who can use them were introduced in 2002 following a fire at one cafe that killed 25 people. during the crackdown following the blaze authorities moved to clean up net cafes and demanded that all of them get permits to operate. in august 2004 chinese authorities shut down 700 websites and arrested 224 people in a crackdown on net porn. at the same time it introduced new controls to block overseas sex sites. the reporters without borders group said in a report that chinese government technologies for e-mail interception and net censorship are among the most highly developed in the world.

1752,"hyundai to build new india plant

south korea's hyundai motor has announced that it plans to build a second plant in india to meet the country's growing demand for cars.

the company didn't give details of its investment but it said the new plant would produce 150,000 cars a year. this will boost the annual production capacity of the company - india's second-largest car manufacturer - to 400,000 units. hyundai expects its sales in india to grow 16% to 250,000 in 2005. by 2010, it expects to nearly double sales to 400,000 cars. the new plant will be built close to the existing one in chennai, in the southern province of tamil nadu.

south korea's top car maker estimates that the indian market will grow 15% this year, to 920,000 vehicles, reaching 1.6 million vehicles by 2010. demand in india has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said. figures show that currently only eight people per thousand are car owners. ""we desperately need to expand our production in order to meet growing demand in the indian auto market, which is growing over 12 percent every year, and to top our competitors,"" chairman chung mong-koo said in the statement. he said the company plans to use india as a base for exports to europe, latin america and the middle east. the company - which controls half of the south korean's market - aims to become a global top five auto maker by 2010.

""voice command-and-control unlocks the potential of devices that can store large digital music collections,"" said ross blanchard, vice president of business development for gracenote. ""these applications will radically change the car entertainment experience, allowing drivers to enjoy their entire music collections without ever taking their hands off the steering wheel,"" he added.

""speech is a natural fit for today's consumer devices, particularly in mobile environments,"" said alan schwartz, vice president of speechworks, a division of scansoft.

""id cards are a means to creating a more secure society,"" he said. mr clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been ""significantly influenced"" by the recommendations of the commons' home affairs committee.

the issue would be debated in parliament next monday as scheduled he insisted. earlier mr kennedy, whose party opposes the id cards plan as ""deeply flawed"" said with christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again. he told bbc radio 4's today programme that mr clarke had been reported to be less enthusiastic about id cards than his predecessors. ""wouldn't this be a good opportunity for a new home secretary, a new broom, to sweep clean in this respect and why do we need this legislation in the first place?"" he asked. earlier this week the tories announced they would back the government's plans although michael howard was forced to deny the shadow cabinet was split over its decision.

they had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members david davis, oliver letwin and tim yeo. the chairman of the bar council, guy mansfield qc has warned there is a real risk that people on the ""margins of society"" would be driven into the hands of extremists.

""[oil prices] will weigh on consumer spending in the short term, and potentially on confidence,"" he said. world oil prices have risen by more than 60% since the start of the year as production struggles to keep pace with soaring demand.

analysts said french companies, keen to protect their profit margins at a time of rising energy costs, were reluctant to take on extra staff. ""[the unemployment figures] show the main problem of the french economy: we have growth but without an improvement in employment,"" said marc touati, an economist at natexis banques populaires. ""politicians must have the will and guts to solve structural unemployment with thorough reforms, otherwise in five or ten years, it will be too late."" obligatory employer contributions to worker welfare programmes mean that it costs more to hire staff in france than in many other european economies. many economists have urged the government to stimulate employment by reducing non-wage payroll costs, and by scrapping restrictions on working hours. the french statistics agency, insee, expects the economy to grow by about 2.4% this year, buoyed by strong consumer spending and business investment. that is above the projected eurozone average of just above 2%.

""we hope the anticipation and excitement over here will create an even bigger buzz by the time we open in london."" auditions begin in canada on thursday, but up to five british actors may join the cast, under a deal struck with canadian actors' equity. the music for the show is being written by bollywood composer ar rahman, who was behind andrew lloyd webber's west end musical bollywood dreams, and in conjuction with the finnish group varttina.

""there will be no singing and dancing hobbits. the music will be in a very traditional mould and draw on ethnic traditions,"" assured mr wallace. the musical's british director is matthew warchus, best known for staging the worldwide stage hit art.

""we will seek further specialist advice in due course to determine just how long scott may be out for."" another potential option, glasgow flanker andrew wilson, has been ruled out for a month after damaging ligaments in both knees against northampton recently.

1780,"crossrail link 'to get go-ahead'

the â£10bn crossrail transport plan, backed by business groups, is to get the go-ahead this month, according to the mail on sunday.

it says the uk treasury has allocated â£7.5bn ($13.99bn) for the project and that talks with business groups on raising the rest will begin shortly. the much delayed crossrail link bill would provide for a fast cross-london rail link. the paper says it will go before the house of commons on 23 february.

a second reading could follow on 16 or 17 march. ""we've always said we are going to introduce a hybrid bill for crossrail in the spring and this remains the case,"" the department for transport said on sunday. jeremy de souza, a spokesman for crossrail, said on sunday he could not confirm whether the treasury was planning to invest â£7.5bn or when the bill would go before parliament.

however, he said some impetus may have been provided by the proximity of an election.

the new line would go out as far as maidenhead, berkshire, to the west of london, and link heathrow to canary wharf via the city. heathrow to the city would take 40 minutes, dramatically cutting journey times for business travellers, and reducing overcrowding on the tube. the line has the support of the mayor of london, ken livingstone, business groups and the government, but there have been three years of arguments over how it should be funded. the mail on sunday's financial mail said the â£7.5bn of treasury money was earmarked for spending in â£2.5bn instalments in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

1267,"gamers could drive high-definition

tv, films, and games have been gearing up for some time now for the next revolution to transform the quality of what is on our screens.

it is called high-definition - hd for short - and it is already hugely popular in japan and the us. it is set, according to analysts, to do for images what cds did for sound. different equipment able to receive hd signals is needed though and is expensive. but europe's gamers may be the early adopters to drive demand. europeans will have to wait until at least 2006 until they see mainstream hdtv.

to view it, it needs to be transmitted in hd format, and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the high-quality resolution. the next generation of consoles, however, are expected to start appearing at the end of 2005, start of 2006. and most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such high-resolution pictures. ""in the next generation [of consoles] hd support is mandatory,"" dr mark tuffy games systems director at digital content firm thx told the bbc news website. ""every game is going to be playable in hd. ""so consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on hdtvs, and who have no content to watch, are going to be blown away by these really high-detail pictures. ""it's going to change really the way they look at gaming.""

at the end of last year, chris deering, sony's european president, made a prediction that 20 million european households would have hdtv sets by 2008. a previous prediction from analysts datamonitor put the figure at 4.6 million by 2008, an increase from an estimated 50,000 sets at the end of 2003. but those in europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology - about â£2,000 - if there are few programmes or films to watch on them. satellite broadcaster bskyb is planning hdtv services in 2006 and the bbc intends to produce all of its content in hd by 2010.

until broadcast rights, format standards - and the practicalities of updating equipment - are agreed, tv content will be limited. all tv images are made up of pixels which go across the screen, and scan lines which go down the screen. most standard uk tv pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. hd offers up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels. this means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard tv. ""probably, in the uk [gaming] is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off, as in 'look what this tv can do', until hd is really adopted by broadcasters,"" explains dr tuffy. but gamers are also the ideal target audience for hd because they always crave better quality graphics, and more immersive gaming experiences. they are used to spending money on hardware to match a game's requirements. demographics have changed too and the ""sweet spot"" for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late 20s. this means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of big-screen, high-definition display technologies and hd projectors, earlier than others.

higher capacity storage discs, such as hd-dvd and blue-ray , are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles - allowing developers more room for detailed graphics.

for console developers though, hd offers some production changes. it could make games production slightly more expensive, thinks dr tuffy. ""but we may see the cross-platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a pc game and apply it to a console,"" he says. ""you are literally going to get to the point, with a lord of the rings game for example, is going to be closer and closer to the actual film, especially the cgi stuff from the dvd. ""and the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game, just now they have almost got it seamless."" with hd, he says, the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big-screen cinema release. this could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry. but it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide. at that point, says dr tuffy, games could become more or less interactive movies.

126,"tories outlining policing plans

local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner, under plans unveiled by the conservatives.

party leader michael howard said the new role would replace ""inconspicuous"" police authorities. he said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable. the lib dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing, while labour criticised ""extravagant"" tory promises on policing.

responding to the plans, the chairman of the police federation of england and wales, which represents rank and file officers, said it was essential operational independence was retained.

jan berry said: ""it is a service, not a political football to be kicked around every time an election approaches. ""these plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground,"" she warned. outlining his crime manifesto, mr howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates. ""the commissioner will have the powers which existing police authorities have,"" he told bbc radio 4's today programme. ""the trouble is, and it's no reflection on the people who are on the police authority - they are good people - but hardly anyone knows who they are."" mr howard said the authorities were not ""providing the local accountability that we want to see"" and that elected police commissioners would be more visible.

critics fear the move could hand control of the police to single-issue campaigners who would ignore the needs of the wider community. lord harris, who sits on the executive of association of police authorities, said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician. ""that is overturning nearly 200 years of the way in which we have organised policing in this country to avoid the politicisation of policing decisions,"" he said.

liberal democrat home affairs spokesman mark oaten said the plan was dangerous and ""could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials"". mr oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a ""minimum policing guarantee"" with their chief constables. a labour party spokesman criticised michael howard's record, saying police numbers had fallen by 1,132 when he was home secretary. he said: ""today the tories are making more extravagant promises on the police without making clear how they would pay for them, other than through fantasy savings to the asylum system."" the tories insists the commissioner role would not be like that of an american sheriff. other tory law and order plans include building more prisons and making criminals serve full jail sentences.

275,"lib dems unveil election slogan

the liberal democrats will present themselves as ""the real alternative"" in the forthcoming general election campaign, charles kennedy has said.

unveiling the slogan at the party's spring conference, he said there was no ""glass ceiling"" to its ambitions. he told delegates that labour had abused the public's trust and that the tories had failed to oppose them. in response, the conservatives insisted that theirs was the party that understood the ""forgotten majority"".

speaking in harrogate mr kennedy said: ""people want a credible, principled political party which offers a different vision of what britain can be.""

only the liberal democrats stood against the iraq war, he said, and they had also provided strong opposition to the government's plans on id cards, anti-terror measures and taxation. he said: ""if you voted conservative in 2001 ... what good did it do you? your vote was wasted. ""what people needed was ... a party which was listening to their concerns; a party which was prepared to stand up and say so; a party which said no to the prime minister."" responding to the claims tory party co-chairman liam fox said: ""like labour, the lib dems are soft on crime, support higher taxes, oppose controlled immigration and support giving europe more control over our lives.""

mr kennedy also outlined his party's plan to impose a 50% income tax rate on earnings over â£100,000 a year. the money would be used to help pay for key policies such as abolishing university tuition fees, scrapping council tax in favour of local income tax, and providing free care for the elderly, he said. labour and the tories claim the sums do not add up, and that working families would be hardest hit. mr kennedy said: ""britain is the fourth-largest economy in the world. we have world class businesses and a world class workforce.

""so why are two million of our pensioners living below the poverty line?"" all the parties are campaigning hard for an expected election in may, although prime minister tony blair has not confirmed any timing. earlier, mr kennedy told radio 4's today programme there was no possibility of forming a coalition with labour in the event of a hung parliament. ""we go into the election as an independent party and we come out as an independent party,"" he said. mr kennedy has been under fire in recent days for missing monday's commons vote on the government's controversial anti-terrorism laws, along with 16 other lib dem mps. on saturday, the lib dem chief executive said it was ""just a cock-up"" that mr kennedy and his colleagues missed the vote, which the government won by a majority of only 14. ""nobody had any idea that was going to happen,"" lord rennard told reporters at the party conference. he said he was certain mps would get another chance to vote against the plans.

tory leader michael howard has dismissed gordon brown's budget as ""vote now, pay later"" spending plans.

the simple fact was that under a new labour government taxes would go up after the election to plug a financial black hole, mr howard said. everyone could see the chancellor's ""sweeteners"", but these hid tax rises for hard working families, he said. labour's ""faltering election campaign"" would not be helped by the package of measures, mr howard added.

mr brown's budget was not about what was good for the country, but ""all about the interests of the labour party,"" the tory leader said after mockingly welcoming the chancellor back to the election campaign. he went on to accuse mr brown of giving with one hand while taking away with the other. he urged the chancellor to admit he had been responsible for dragging ""millions of people in to the net"" to pay stamp duty and inheritance tax. ""we can all see the sweeteners, but they hide the crippling tax rises for hard-working families that are inevitable if labour wins.""

he also accused the government and the chancellor of running out of solutions to the problems britain faced. ""their only answer is to tax, to spend and to waste - to get people to vote now and pay later."" mr brown liked to rattle off ""magical balances conjured out of thin air"" in a bid to convince people there was no ""black hole"" in the nation's finances, the tory leader said. ""this dodgy government that brought us the dodgy dossier is now publishing a dodgy budget based on dodgy numbers,"" he said. ""you now propose to borrow, over the next six years, no less than â£168 billion; so much for prudence. ""the chancellor's forecasts of surpluses are no better than the prime minister's forecasts of weapons of mass destruction.""

mr brown's council tax rebate for pensioners was â£300 less than what the tories were offering, mr howard said. there was nothing in the budget that would put more police on the streets, make hospitals cleaner or give parents and teachers the discipline and skills they wanted in schools. people would face a ""clear choice"" at the election, either ""more waste and higher taxes under labour or lower taxes and value for money with the conservatives"", he said. ""that's the battleground of this election. that's what this election is going to be all about and i say bring it on,"" he concluded, to loud tory cheering.

912,"souness backs smith for scotland

graeme souness believes walter smith would be the perfect choice to succeed berti vogts as scotland manager.

souness's former assistant at rangers is hot favourite to take over from vogts, who resigned on monday. ""walter is most definitely the ideal candidate for that job. he'd be perfect for it,"" souness told bbc sport. the scottish football association has appointed tommy burns as provisional caretaker-boss for the friendly against sweden on 17 november. ""he fits the bill because of his knowledge and understanding of the scotland team and football. he is experienced and has been successful."" souness added: ""walter is a real football person, as i know from working with him at ibrox. ""on top of all that he is a proper human being who would command the instant respect of the players and everyone involved in scottish football."" souness joined sir alex ferguson in backing smith's claims. the scottish football association is about to embark on the search for vogts successor after appointing tommy burns in a caretaker capacity. ferguson said: ""he (smith) would be the outstanding candidate as far as i'm concerned. ""you need somebody who knows what they're doing and walter would bring a wealth of experience to the job."" the man utd boss continued: ""i don't know what credentials are needed to do the job but it's a job that needs a lot of experience. ""he was my assistant with scotland and here at manchester united and he has also managed glasgow rangers. ""he would need to change the whole shape of scottish football and radical changes are needed."" smith was assistant to ferguson at the world cup in mexico in 1986. the former everton and rangers boss has been out of the game since a spell as manchester united assistant last term. bbc sport understands that smith would be willing to discuss taking over if he was approached by the scottish fa.

136,"campaign 'cold calls' questioned

labour and the conservatives are still telephoning the millions of people who have signed up to make sure they do not get marketing ""cold calls"".

the parties say they can stick to the rules by ensuring that their calls are not marketing - for instance by asking about people's voting intentions. the lib dems are asking the watchdog overseeing the rules to stop the calls. the information commissioner's office says surveys are allowed but there is a ""grey"" area if personal data is kept. telephone call centres are expected to be used as never before by all the three major parties in the run-up to the general election.

but seven million telephone numbers are on the telephone preference service (tps) lists, which ban unsolicited sales and marketing calls. both schemes are run by the direct marketing association and backed by eu directives on privacy and electronic communications.

the rules on marketing calls apply as much to politicians as to private sector companies. but that does not mean labour and the tories are not calling people signed up to the tps. a labour party spokesman told the bbc news website the party avoided those on tps lists when telephoning people about membership or fundraising. but that did not happen for ""voter identification"" calls. ""when we ask which party they will vote for, that is not marketing and we have very clear legal advice that it is not,"" he said. ""so it is not covered by the telephone preference service.""

he said the party always asked people if they would be happy to be contacted again and if they said no, they were not rung again. a conservative spokeswoman said the party stuck to the rules when it rang tps subscribers. she said: ""we do apply tps but in line with the law. we would not do things that are not allowed in the law."" a spokesman for the information commissioner's office said it would be classed as marketing if political parties telephoned people to encourage them to vote for them. but the rules did allow polling organisations to telephone people about their voting intentions if they recorded them only as part of a bigger set of statistics, not person by person. ""if a political party was doing that than it may be that also would not be marketing,"" he said.

the spokesman said it might be considered unsolicited marketing if a party recorded voting preferences with a view to marketing information in the future. the spokesman said there was ""no yes or no"" answer and the area was ""pretty grey"". he added: ""if someone complained, then we would investigate that. political parties are aware of the regulations. at the last by-elections, we reminded them."" lib dem chairman matthew taylor has now written to the watchdog saying: ""the advice we have received on several previous occasions is that such phone calls are illegal."" he says evidence from local lib dem parties around the country suggests there are ""significant"" numbers of such calls. ""i hope you can therefore take swift and efficient action to ensure that this ceases,"" he tells the commissioner. mr taylor argues there should be new guidelines so all parties can act in the same way if the watchdog believes the rules allow parties to ring tps numbers about voting intentions and later urge those people to vote for them.

2090,"ryanair in $4bn boeing plane deal

budget airline ryanair has placed an order for 70 boeing 737-800 planes, in a deal valued at $4bn (â£2.1bn) which should lead to 2,500 new ryanair jobs.

it also has an option for a further 70 aircraft, a move which brings the ryanair/boeing order book up to 225 firm orders and options on 193 more. ryanair said the new planes would help it to cut operating costs further. the carrier reported a drop in quarterly profit earlier this year after it was hit by higher fuel costs. however, when it reported the results, the airline was upbeat about prospects for 2005, despite tough competition in the budget airline market.

ryanair chairman david bonderman said that the 737-800 had ""significantly reduced our unit operating costs and allowed us to reduce air fares each year for the last five years"".

""with this new order and new pricing in place, ryanair expects that unit operating costs (excluding fuel) will continue to fall each year for the next five years,"" he added. at the end of this year, ryanair will have taken delivery of about 100 new planes, while the 70 new orders are due for delivery between 2008 and 2012. the airline said that when all these planes have been delivered, it will be able to carry more than 70 million passengers a year, making it europe's largest airline. about 2,500 new jobs should be created in the next seven years, it added. the order can be seen as good news for boeing, which in recent years has been overtaken by european plane maker airbus as the world's biggest-selling plane maker.

the prop said: ""if we get stuffed in the front five our backs have had it. ""the mentality of the french is 'scrum, scrum, scrum'. we will see how good france are and the scrum is the key. ""i just hope [the backs] carry on where they left off against italy. it's just up to us in the forwards to win the ball and give them the opportunity."" wales have won two of their last three visits to stade de france, having secured back-to-back wins under graham henry in 1999 and 2001. and with the likes of shane williams and gavin henson finding top form at the right time, mike ruddock's team is now one of international rugby's most potent attacking threats. ""gavin is ridiculously talented. he has been bouncing around the place this week, so he is up for it,"" warned jones.

france have been criticised for their uncharacteristic one-dimensional play in their victories over scotland and france. captain fabien pelous has acknowledged his side needs to show more attacking flair, but stressed the game with be won or lost up front. the lock believes the welsh forwards are not big enough to trouble his side in the scrum or line-out, but jones insisted his fellow front-row colleagues have nothing to fear.

""gethin [jenkins] won't be intimidated tomorrow, none of us will,"" said jones, who will be facing france for the first time. ""we will go out there and front up and hopefully get the ball out to the backs. ""me and gethin are quite young so it is good to have someone of mefin's experience in there. ""mefin is a good thinker who puts things across. but what is the saying? if you are good enough you are old enough and gethin certainly is.

978,"set your television to wow

television started off as a magical blurry image. then came the sharpness, the colour and the widescreen format. now the tv set is taking another leap forward into a crystal clear future, although those in europe will have to be patient.

after years of buzz about high-definition tv (hdtv) it is finally taking off in a handful of countries around the world, mainly the us and japan. if you believe the hype, then hdtv will so wow you, that you will never want to go back to your old telly. ""hdtv is just the latest must-have technology in viewers' homes,"" says jo flaherty, a senior broadcaster with the cbs network in the us. all television images are made up of pixels, going across the screen, and scan lines going down. british tv pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels. by contrast, hdtv offers up to 1,080 active lines, with each line made up of 1,920 pixels. the result is a picture which can be up to six times as sharp as standard tv. but to get the full impact, programmes need to be broadcast in this format and you need a hdtv set to receive them. most new computer displays are already capable of handling high-resolution pictures. viewers in japan, the us, australia, canada and south korea are already embracing the new tv technology, with a selection of primetime programmes being broadcast in the new format, which includes 5.1 digital surround sound.

but tv viewers in europe will have to wait to enjoy the eye-blasting high-definition images.

many high-end european tv programmes, such as the recent athens olympics, are already being produced in high-definition. but they still reach your screen in the old 625 lines. the prospects for getting sharper images soon do not seem very encouraging. according to consultants strategy analytics, only 12% of homes in europe will have tvs capable of showing programmes in high-definition by 2008. but the hdtv hype spilling out of the us and japan has spurred european broadcasters and consumer electronic companies to push for change. big sports and entertainment events are set to help trigger the general public's attention. the 2006 world cup in germany will be broadcast in high-definition.

in the uk, satellite broadcaster bskyb is planning hdtv services in 2006. there is already a hdtv service in europe called euro1080. other european broadcasters, especially in france and germany, also aiming to launch similar services.

in britain, digital satellite and cable are largely seen as the natural home for hdtv, at least while a decision is taken regarding terrestrial broadcast options. the communications watchdog ofcom could hand over some terrestrial frequencies freed up when the uk switches off its analogue tv signal. for now, broadcasters like the bbc are working on their own hdtv plans, although with no launch date in sight. ""the bbc will start broadcasting in hdtv when the time is right, and it would not be just a showcase, but a whole set of programming,"" says andy quested, from the bbc's high-definition support group. ""we have made the commitment to produce all our output in high-definition by 2010, which would put us on the leading edge."" one of the options under consideration is to offer high-definition pictures on the web. the bbc has already dipped its toe into this, including some hdtv content in recent trials of its interactive media player - a video player for pcs. it is planning to offer special releases of selected flagship programmes online in the near future. according to mr quested, this could help put europe back into the running in the race to switch to hdtv. this is backed by recent research which suggests that the number of europeans with broadband has exploded over the past 12 months, with the web eating into tv viewing habits.

sale sharks director of rugby philippe saint-andre has re-opened rugby's club-versus-country debate.

sale host bath in the powergen cup on friday, but the frenchman has endured a ""difficult week"" with six players away on england's six nations training camp. ""it's an important game but we've just the one full session. it's the same for everyone but we need to manage it. ""if five players or more are picked for your country they should move the date of the game,"" he told bbc sport. unless the authorities agree to make changes, saint-andre believes england's national team will suffer as clubs opt to sign foreigners and retired internationals. ""that's not good for the politics of the english team or for english rugby,"" he argues. it is an issue he has taken up before, most notably during the autumn internationals when sale lost all three zurich premiership matches they played.

now he fears it could derail the club's hopes of cup silverware after eight players, including captain jason robinson and fly-half charlie hodgson, were away with their countries. ""we're in the quarter-finals, it's always better to play at home than away and it's a great opportunity,"" he added. ""but we have to be careful. bath have just been knocked out of europe and will make it a tough game. it also comes at the end of a very, very difficult week. ""sebastien bruno's been with france, jason white with scotland and there are six with england, that's eight players plus injuries - 13 players out of a squad of 31.

gloucester have also been caught in a club-versus-country conflict after england sought a second medical opinion on james simpson-daniel's fitness. the winger is carrying a shoulder injury and the national team management believe he requires time on the sidelines. as a result he misses the cherry and white's quarter-final at home to bristol. ""under the elite player squad agreement, england wanted a second opinion, which they can do,"" director of rugby nigel melville told the gloucester citizen.

""they obviously want him for international rugby and we want him for club rugby in what is a very important game for us. there is a conflict of interests. ""the surgeon who carried out his operation said he was fine for us but england say he is still vulnerable to be damaged again and want him on a full rehab programme."" simpson-daniel added: ""i've said to nigel i want to be back playing and that means if everything goes well this week, i can target the worcester game (on 29 january) for a return.""

apple has taken more legal action to stop online leaks of its new products.

the computer giant has sued three men for releasing preview versions of its latest mac osx software onto file-sharing sites prior to its release. it said two versions of the operating system, codenamed tiger, were put onto the net in october and december. it is the second time in two weeks apple has taken legal action to protect its future products. tiger is due to be shipped in early 2005. last week, it filed a lawsuit against ""unnamed individuals"" who leaked details about new products onto the web.

the latest action was against members of the apple developer connection, a group of programmers which gets to see test versions of upcoming software so they can develop or change their own programs to work with them. ""members of apple developer connection receive advance copies of apple software under strict confidentiality agreements, which we take very seriously to protect our intellectual property,"" apple said in a statement.

it added that its future financial results were very much dependent on developing and improving its operating systems and other software. it is thought the men used sites which employ bittorrent technology. with bittorrent technology, sites do not host actual files being shared, instead they host a link that points people to others that have the particular file. last week, the motion picture association of america launched a legal campaign targeting websites that operate using the bittorrent system in an effort to clamp down on movie piracy. apple is no stranger to taking legal action against those who leak product information. in december 2002, it sued a former contractor who allegedly put drawings, images and engineering details of its powermac g4 computer online. the latest action was filed on monday in the us district court in california. it comes just weeks before the macworld conference in san francisco, used to showcase new products.

526,"athens memories soar above lows

well, it's goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens.

obviously, there's no getting away from the differing fortunes of kelly holmes and paula radcliffe. but i want to remind you of a few more events that made 2004 another year to remember - or forget - for athletics. 

 

one of my favourite olympic moments was kelly's success in the 800m.

winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality. kelly had been full of ""should i, shouldn't i?"" thoughts about going for the double in athens. i thought why wouldn't you do the 800m, it's your best event? it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story. 

 

the victory for the british men's 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games. i think the four of them - jason gardener, darren campbell, marlon devonish and mark lewis-francis - knew deep down that it was their best chance of a medal. the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake. 

 

hicham el guerrouj's olympic double is a much bigger achievement than kelly's on a global scale.

he was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5,000m titles. as soon as he had added the 5,000m crown and i had finished commentating, i jumped up, ran down the stairs, pushed everyone out the way and just gave him a big hug. he is one of the few african runners who has embraced the tradition of the mile and he loves to hear all the roger bannister stories. hicham is someone i enjoy having a bit of time with, even though my french and his english are not very good. 

 

what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well. there were a set of circumstances around athens that conspired to produce a very dramatic ending which i think has been greatly misunderstood. dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10,000m five days later was not wise. that was her heart and not her head reacting. paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.

things like niggling injuries, not being able to do all her running sessions and feeling the pressure of the race looming ahead of her. i think she came to the start line in athens physically and emotionally drained. and if even the smallest thing doesn't feel right when you are preparing to race a marathon, 10 miles down the road it will hit you like a brick wall. the positive thing to take from paula's olympics it that she will have learned a lot from it and so will a lot of people - including me. 

 

purely as a race, paula's victory in the new york marathon has to go down as one of the most thrilling. it was so nip-and-tuck between her and kenya's susan chepkemei and you don't usually get that kind of excitement in marathons. it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because, to use one of my favourite words, paula showed real ""bouncebackability"". and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out. 

 

kelly and the 4x100m boys' victories papered over the cracks in the general performance of the british team. we should be concerned that we're not producing enough people who are capable of reaching finals at senior level.

the only individual men's finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500m. i am beginning to look down and wonder where are the new breed? and that's where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy. dani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gb. the thing is if we don't have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn't look good for the beijing olympics and beyond. 

 

i tell you what i really enjoyed this year, benita johnson winning the world cross country championships back in march. in the absence of paula, we tend to think of the event as something of an african preserve. so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special. 

 

to be honest, i'm getting bored with all the drug scandals, especially balco. i just wish the whole thing would come to a head so we can move on.

having said that, i'm always pleased when drugs cheats are caught because it shows the sport is standing up to it and not turning a blind eye anymore. and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle. we need more people to come forward and help the authorities kick out the cheats. as regards the case against greek sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou, well suspicions have been hanging over kenteris for a while. the bottom line is we cannot keep letting drugs damage the sport because if we do then it stops everyone enjoying it.
","and it was a bit of a rarity for me too because i genuinely did not have an inkling how the race was going to pan out.dropping out of the marathon was the right thing to do but starting in the 10,000m five days later was not wise.it was such good fun to commentate on her 1500m and it was nice to be able to be part of her athens story.one of my favourite olympic moments was kelly's success in the 800m.winning that race was the key to her success because if she won that then the 1500m would be a bit of a formality.so to have an australian come up and deliver such a surprise was something special.the victory for the british men's 4x100m relay team was a bit of a surprise but a great climax to the games.that was her heart and not her head reacting.he was the first man since for 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5,000m titles.and one of the positive things to come out of balco is people are starting to blow the whistle.it was also a real delight for all athletics fans because, to use one of my favourite words, paula showed real ""bouncebackability"".the thing is if we don't have athletes getting into the finals at junior level then it really doesn't look good for the beijing olympics and beyond.what happened to paula in athens this year is the obvious low on a personal level and for the expectations of the nation as well.the only individual men's finalist on the track was michael east in the 1500m.dani barnes came fourth in the 1500m and she was the highest finisher for team gb.paula had a lot of little things going wrong in her preparation and on the day.the lads had run poorly in the individual sprints so maybe they did lift their game when they knew something was really at stake.well, it's goodbye to another olympic year and as usual there were plenty of highs and lows in athens.and that's where things begin to look even gloomier for british athletics as we did not win any medals at the world junior championships in italy.",sport,944,362

""but the guidance is positive and pricing going up is good news."" third-quarter sales rose 34% to 20.9bn rupees. one problem identified by wipro was the high turnover of its staff. it said that 90% of employees at its business process outsourcing operations had had to be replaced.

our mission to brighten up your working lives continues - and this time, we're taking a long hard look at your offices.

over the next few months, our panel of experts will be listening to your gripes about where you work, and suggesting ways to make your workspace more efficient, more congenial or simply prettier. this week, we're hearing from marianne petersen, who is planning to convert a barn in sweden into a base for her freelance writing work. click on the link under her photograph to read her story, and then scroll down to see what the panel have to say. and if you want to take part in the series, go to the bottom of the story to find out how to get in touch.

working from home presents a multitude of challenges. understanding your work personality allows you to work in terms of your own style. do you feel confident about your work output without conferring with others? are you able to retain discipline and self motivate to get the job done? do you build on the ideas of others - or are you a more introspective problem solver?. in order for a virtual office to succeed, keeping the boundary between work and home life is essential. it may be useful to be quite rigid about who is allowed to visit, and to keep strict office hours. referring to the space as work will give those around you a clear message that this is professional space. it is imperative to consider how to bring the outside world into yours, keeping up to date with developments and maintaining a network. isolated work environments mean this has to be carefully thought out, and a strategy has to be developed that suits both your personality and your industry. joining professional groups or forming a loose association of like-minded people may assist. it is useful to structure these meetings in advance as often they get relegated to less important status when times are busy - with the danger that when the workload eases, they have to be resurrected.



prior to any interior work being undertaken it is essential to ensure that the roof and walls are made water-and-weather-tight, and the structure is checked for stability. it appears that the roof trusses may need repairs and additional bracing.

ideally, the roof should be replaced with an outer material in keeping with the character and location of the barn. this would also allow for a well-insulated inner skin to be provided which should be light coloured. it is likely that the most efficient way of heating the building is with electricity. in order to provide this the owner will need to have an electrical engineer calculate the potential heating, power and lighting load to make sure the mains supply and distribution capacity are adequate. ideally, it would be good to have a mains water supply and some means of drainage for toilet and washing facilities. the walls should be dry lined with a single skin of plasterboard laid over rockwool slab which will allow good wall insulation and the power and lighting circuits to be concealed, and the walls should be painted in a light colour. the owner mentions she might lay a new floor over the existing planks; this will improve the insulation and offer a level surface. i would suggest laying new oak veneer planks which can work in with the character of the barn. as for lighting, consider a combination of floor mounted uplights, wall lights (wall washers) and selected downlights. use a combination of mains voltage fluorescent fittings and dimmable units which can vary the light levels and the feel of the interior.

the layout of this office reflects the need to have a working area and a more relaxed meeting space. large desk space and extensive storage would combine with tub chairs to maximise the space available. the finishes chosen for the furniture will need to reflect the unusual setting, while the lighting and temperature control mechanisms used will further influence the workplace.



regarding accessing the internet via the connection in the main house, your plan of going wireless is sensible. a wireless router/access point in the house with a wireless lan card in the pc in the renovated area may be sufficient. however, important points to consider are the distance between the two buildings and the nature of the materials through which the signals have to pass, which could result in a weak signal strength. you may require an additional wireless access point in the renovated area. your local it supplier will be able to advise on this. if you haven't already invested in robust firewall and anti-virus software, it is essential to do so, to protect your investment. to really take advantage of wireless technology, you might consider a laptop computer and a docking station with external mouse and monitor. or you could use one of the new tablet computers, which allow you to write directly on the screen and convert into text with built-in hand recognition software. and finally, you will save money and space by considering a multi-function product for print, scan, copy and fax.

601,"gb select holmes for double bid

kelly holmes has been chosen for both the 800m and 1500m at next month's european indoor championships - despite not yet confirming her availability.

the double-olympic champion is still undecided about whether to compete in her first european indoors in madrid. but uk athletics chief max jones believes it is likely holmes will race. he said: ""it's worth a punt, isn't it? she's gone back to training. if she's confident she will pick one (distance). the programme does not permit both."" if holmes does take her place in the gb side, she has already indicated that 1500m will be her favoured distance. under championship rules, she does not have to decide until 24 hours before the event begins in madrid on 4 march. jones added: ""she was pleased with her run in birmingham (at last weekend's grand prix). ""i am inclined to think she will (compete). it could depend on how training goes and she will have to be close to top form."" and he admitted holmes' presence would be a great boost to the rest of the norwich union gb team. ""she is a very good team member and is very good to have there,"" he added. meanwhile, there is no surprises in the rest of the great britain team announced on tuesday.

defending 60m champion jason gardener is included and will be chasing his third successive gold medal. he will be joined in the event by mark lewis-francis - runner-up behind him three years ago in vienna - and new boy darren chin. kelly sotherton has been invited by championship organisers to compete against carolina kluft in the pentathlon. sotherton finished third in the olympic heptathlon in athens, where the swede took gold. there are 16 newcomers at this level of competition in gb's 46-strong team. the championships will be the last to be attended by jones before he retires to be succeeded by dave collins. jones said: ""the olympic games is the overwhelming target for uka and therefore it is beneficial to start the next four-year cycle with a not-so-pressurised major games. ""the european indoor championships always provide a chance for the young and inexperienced to make a name for themselves and the current indoor season has produced some exciting new talent. ""madrid is the first small step on a long journey to beijing and the 2008 olympics but for some of the emerging athletes, this will be a very important step.""

2070,"us insurer marsh cuts 2,500 jobs

up to 2,500 jobs are to go at us insurance broker marsh & mclennan in a shake up following bigger-than-expected losses.

the insurer said the cuts were part of a cost-cutting drive, aimed at saving millions of dollars. marsh posted a $676m (â£352m) loss for the last three months of 2004, against a $375m (â£195.3m) profit a year before. it blamed an $850m payout to settle a price-rigging lawsuit, brought by new york attorney general elliot spitzer. under the settlement announced in january, marsh took a pre-tax charge of $618m in the october-to-december quarter, on top of the $232m charge from the previous quarter. ""clearly 2004 was the most difficult year in mmc's financial history,"" marsh chief executive michael cherkasky said.

an ongoing restructuring drive at the group also led to a $337m hit in the fourth quarter, the world's biggest insurer said.

analysts expect its latest round of cuts to focus on its brokerage unit, which employs 40,000 staff. the latest layoffs will take the total number of jobs to go at the firm to 5,500 and are expected to lead to annual savings of more than $375m. as part of its efforts to cut costs, the company said it was halving its dividend payment to 17 cents a shares from 34 cents, a move which should enable it to save $360m. looking ahead, mr cherkasky forecast profitable growth for the year ahead ""with an operating margin in the upper-teens, and with the opportunity for further margin expansion"". meanwhile, the company also announced it would spin-off its mmc capital private equity unit, which manages the $3bn trident funds operation, to a group of employees. marsh did not say when the move would take place, but said it had signed a letter of intent.

the insurer hit the headlines in october last year when it faced accusations of price rigging. new york attorney general elliot spitzer sued the company, accusing it of receiving illegal payments to steer clients to selected firms as well as rigging bids and fixing prices. in january, marsh agreed to pay $850m to settle the suit - a figure in line with the placement fees it collected in 2003 - and agreed to change its business practices. in february, a former senior executive pleaded guilty to criminal charges in a wide-ranging probe of fraud and bid-rigging in the insurance industry. in january, a former senior vice president also pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to the investigation. in an effort to reform its business practises, marsh said it has already introduced new leadership, new compliance procedures and new ways of dealing with customers. ""as a result, we are ready to put these matters behind us and move ahead in 2005 to restore the trust our clients have placed in us and to rebuild shareholder value,"" mr cherkasky said.

919,"llewellyn plans wales retirement

wales record cap holder gareth llewellyn will retire from test rugby at the end of the six nations.

the veteran lock, who is 36 at the end of february, told bbc wales scrum v that it is time for him to bring down the curtain on his 92-cap wales career. llewellyn is on a one-season deal with french club side narbonne, but said he may consider retiring from all rugby. ""i don't know what i'll do next year, whether to carry on playing or make a change in my career,"" llewellyn said. ""narbonne are really keen for me to stay on for next year, so i've got to decide whether to stay on there or maybe go somewhere else, but ultimitely coaching is where i'd like to end up. ""i've done all the coaching awards and everything you can do in that respect, so it's just hopefully getting a chance somewhere."" fellow locks robert sidoli and brent cockbain, who both scored tries in saturday's six nations win in italy, are wales coach mike ruddock's preferred starters in the second row.

with the resurgence of the dragons' ian gough and the adaptibility of lock-cum-flanker jon thomas on the bench, llewellyn has not yet made a match-day squad this six nations campaign. but the former neath and ospreys player is still targetting one last outing in the red shirt. ""if i do get on the field then brilliant, although the boys are doing really well and i'm very pleased for them,"" llewellyn added. ""we've had some really tough years in wales and the players have been through a hell of a lot. ""sometimes the easiest thing would have been to throw the towel in and walk away, but a few of us dug in there and it's really nice to see some of the boys getting the rewards now. ""i was going to retire at the end of the last six nations, i'd even told some of the boys in the squad about it. ""but mike (ruddock) asked me to carry on for another season, which i've done, still part of the squad, still trying to help them out as much as i can."" llewellyn made his wales debut in 1989 against new zealand as a 20-year-old, having caught the selectors' eyes in the all blacks' tour match against neath. the 6ft 6in player has not looked back since, going on to break neil jenkins' wales cap record on 12 june 2004 in the 50-44 loss in argentina.

""there's been lots of highs - winning the six nations in '94, beating england in '93, i've been on some great tours and seen some fantastic countries,"" llewellyn said. ""but i think the best thing of all for me was the time i spent with the players, i've met some great guys in rugby and made some great friends. ""it'll be a bit strange on international days having to find somewhere to watch wales play, but at least i might have time to get my golf handicap down!"" llewellyn captained neath for seven seasons, while being an integral part of the neath-swansea ospreys regional side's first season. but with the ospreys building for the future, llewellyn was eventually forced to look to france for employment - digging in his heels during contract negotiations to insist he must be allowed to play for wales.

2169,"us regulator to rule on pain drug

us food and drug regulators will decide on friday whether to recommend the sale of painkillers that have been linked to a high risk of heart attack and stroke.

the food and drug administration (fda) advisory panel will give its verdict after hearing evidence for three days. the painkillers - called cox-2 inhibitors - are sold under brand names such as celebrex and vioxx. vioxx was withdrawn from shops last year but merck said it would consider selling it if it gets fda approval. the fda has been asked to decide if the benefits to patients justify the increased risks.

putting vioxx back on the shelves is likely to boost profits at merck and make easier any legal battles with people who claim to have been injured by the drug, analysts said.

merck voluntarily stopped sales of vioxx on 30 september, a move which caused the firm's fourth-quarter earnings to slide to $1.1bn (â£581m), from $1.4bn a year earlier. merck's shares tumbled more than 10% on the news and the company has had to set aside millions of dollars to cover the cost of vioxx-related litigation. alarm bells were rung by a research note called approve which showed that the risk of heart attack and stroke doubled in patients who had been taking the drug for at least 18 months. the cox-2 inhibitors were developed by drug companies, including merck and pfizer, because they cause users fewer stomach problems than other painkillers.

pfizer is still selling its celebrex and bextra products, though investigations have suggested that they may also be harmful to the heart. merck's announcement of a possible reintroduction of vioxx caught analysts by surprise. merck's head of research peter kim said that it withdrew vioxx ""based on the information that was available to us at the time, knowing there were alternative therapies"". he went on to say that things have since changed in the light of new reports. ""given this new information, its is not clear that the cardiovascular risk observed in approve makes vioxx unique in the class of similar drugs marketed in the us,"" mr kim explained.

on thursday, david graham from the fda's office of drug safety told the advisory panel that ""there really doesn't appear to be a need for cox-2"" inhibitors. according to calculations presented to the us senate by dr graham in november, vioxx may be linked to as many as to 56,000 american deaths. facing stem criticism for its handling of the vioxx case, the fda said on tuesday that it will create an independent body to oversee the safety of drugs already in the market place. european regulators, meanwhile, ruled on thursday that patients who have had heart disease or a stroke should not take cox-2 inhibitors. the european medicines agency also said doctors should be ""cautious"" about giving the drugs to patients who have risk factors for heart disease.

""prince returned to centre stage after a decade in the commercial wilderness,"" the magazine reported. the singer's 2004 tour took $90.3m (â£48.5m) in ticket sales and he sold 1.9 million copies of his latest album musicology.

although she grossed more than prince last year, madonna remained in second place because of the ""monumental"" production costs of her tour. heavy metal band metallica's madly in anger with the world tour helped push their 2004 earnings up to $43.1m (â£23.1m). they were ahead of sir elton john, who took fourth place and almost $42.7m (â£23m) from performances including a debut on the las vegas strip. other seasoned performers in the list included rod stewart, whose sold-out shows and third volume of the great american songbook covers album helped net him â£35m (â£19m). the highest-ranking rap act in the list was 50 cent, who at number 19 took $24m (â£13m) to the bank.

mr fox responded by accusing the prime minister of ""hiding away from the scrutiny of london's media"". the liberal democrats also say they are planning to hold daily news conferences with charles kennedy. on mrs howard's role, mr fox said: ""sandra has already been campaigning with michael on a number of visits and has been undertaking short visits herself. ""that pattern will continue. it's worked very well up until now."" mrs howard made her debut speech at the conservative party conference in bournemouth last october. she used her speech on the fringe to highlight the work of a drugs charity, addaction, which she supports. mrs howard has also appeared along side her husband on tv chat shows. during an interview on itv1's this morning she said she often criticised her husband for not showing the side of him that she knows.

the us trade deficit widened by more than expected in october, hitting record levels after higher oil prices raised import costs, figures have shown

the trade shortfall was $55.5bn (â£29bn), up 9% from september, the commerce department said. that pushed the 10 month deficit to $500.5bn. imports rose by 3.4%, while exports increased by only 0.6%. a weaker dollar also increased the cost of imports, though this should help drive export demand in coming months. ""things are getting worse, but that's to be expected,"" said david wyss of standard & poor's in new york. ""the first thing is that when the dollar goes down, it increases the price of imports. ""we are seeing improved export orders. things seem to be going in the right direction.""

despite this optimism, significant concerns remain as to how the us will fund its trade and budget deficits should they continue to widen. another problem highlighted by analysts was the growing trade gap with china, which has been accused of keeping its currency artificially weak in order to boost exports. the us imported almost $20bn worth of goods from china during october, exporting a little under $3bn. ""it seems the key worry that has existed in the currency market still remains,"" said anthony crescenzi, a bond strategist at miller tabak in new york. the trade deficit and the shortfall with china ""are big issues going forward"". the commerce department figures caused the dollar to weaken further despite widespread expectations that the federal reserve will raise interest rates for a fifth time this year. borrowing costs are tipped to rise by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.25% at a fed meeting later on tuesday.

china overtook the us to become japan's biggest trading partner in 2004, according to numbers released by japan's finance ministry on wednesday.

china accounted for 20.1% of japan's trade in 2004, compared with 18.6% for the us. in 2003, the us was ahead with 20.5% and china came second with 19.2%. the change highlights china's growing importance as an economic powerhouse. in 2004, japan's imports from and exports to china (and hong kong) added up to 22,201bn yen ($214.6bn;â£114.5bn). this is the highest figure for japanese trade with china since records began in 1947. it compares with 20,479.5bn yen in trade with the us.

trade with the us during 2004 was hurt by one-off factors, including a 13-month ban on us beef imports following the discovery of a cow infected with mad cow disease (bse) in the us. however, economists predict china will become an even more important japanese trading partner in the coming years. on tuesday, figures showed china's economy grew by 9.5% in 2004 and experts say the overall growth picture remains strong. analysts see two spurs to future growth as being china's membership of the world trade organisation and lower trade tariffs. during 2004, japan's trade surplus grew 17.9% to 12.011 trillion yen, with more than half the surplus, 6.962 trillion yen, accounted for by its trade with the us. in december, the surplus grew 1.8% on a year ago to 1.14 trillion yen thanks to stronger-than-expected exports.

but many labour backbenchers are said to be dissatisfied with the way election campaigning has gone and have said they wanted to see the chancellor take a bigger role. some commentators say the tories have grasped the initiative, putting labour on the back foot, having to respond to conservative policy announcements. these claims follow various opinion polls which suggest the tories have been gaining on labour. party strategists are believed to want to bring mr brown to centre-stage having seen support rise, in private polling, after his budget last week. but another report in the sunday telegraph claims mr milburn is unwilling to allow any new role for the chancellor to come at his expense. mr johnson told bbc news: ""gordon brown will play a central role in any election campaign.

us economic growth accelerated in the third quarter, helped by strong consumer spending, official figures have shown.

the economy expanded at an annual rate of 3.7% in the july to september period, the commerce department said. the figure marked an increase on the 3.3% growth recorded in the second quarter, but fell short of the 4.2% rate pencilled in by forecasters. the increase reflected the biggest jump in consumer spending in a year. ""it was a little softer than the consensus, but not a real surprise,"" said gary thayer, an economist at ag edwards & sons. friday's growth estimate is one of the last significant pieces of economic data before the 2 november presidential election.

democrat challenger john kerry has criticised president george w bush's handling of the economy, pointing to a net loss of over 800,000 jobs since mr bush took office. analysts said the economy was still not growing fast enough to stimulate large-scale job creation. ""it's a pretty good growth rate, but it may not be good enough to create enough jobs,"" said robert brusca, chief economist at fact and opinion economics in new york. however, president bush is expected to point to commerce department figures showing that consumer spending grew at 4.6% in the third quarter, up from just 1.6% in the second, as evidence that his policies are generating solid growth. consumer spending accounts for about two thirds of all economic activity in the us.

the weaker than expected growth figure makes it less likely that the us federal reserve will raise interest rates next month, economists said.

the explosion in consumer technology is to continue into 2005, delegates at the world's largest gadget show, in las vegas, have been told.

the number of gadgets in the shops is predicted to grow by 11%, while devices which talk to each other will become increasingly important. ""everything is going digital,"" kirsten pfeifer from the consumer electronics association, told the bbc news website. the consumer electronics show (ces) featured the pick of 2005's products. ""consumers are controlling what they want and technologies like hdtvs [high-definition tvs], digital radio, and digital cameras will remain strong in 2005. ""all the products on show really showed the breadth and depth of the industry."" despite showing diversity, some delegates attending complained that the showcase lacked as much ""wow factor"" as in previous years.

the portable technologies on show also reflected one of the buzzwords of ces, which was the ""time and place shifting"" of multimedia content - being able to watch and listen to video and music anywhere, at any time. at the start of last year's ces, the cea predicted there would be an average growth of 4% in 2004. that figure was surpassed with the rise in popularity of portable digital music players, personal video recorders and digital cameras. it was clear also that gadgets are becoming a lot more about lifestyle choice, with fashion and personalisation becoming increasingly key to the way gadgets are designed. part of this has been the rise in spending power of the ""generation x-ers"" who have grown up with technology and who now have the spending power and desire for more devices that suit them. more than 57% of the consumer electronics market is made up of female buyers, according to cea research. hybrid devices, which combine a number of multimedia functions, were also in evidence on the show floor. ""a lot of this is driven by just the ability to do it,"" said stephen baker, a consumer electronics analyst with retail research firm npd group. ""some of these functions cost next to nothing to add.""

as well as the show floor showcasing everything from tiny wearable mp3 players to giant high-definition tvs, several keynote speeches were made by industry leaders, such as microsoft chief bill gates. despite several embarrassing technical glitches during mr gate's pre-show speech, he announced several new partnerships - mainly for the us market. he unveiled new ways of letting people take tv shows recorded on personal video recorders and watch them back on portable devices. he disappointed some, however, by failing to announce any details of the next generation of the xbox games console. another disappointment was the lack of exposure sony's new portable games device, the psp, had at the show. sony said the much-anticipated gadget would most likely start shipping in march for the us and europe. it went on sale in japan before christmas. there were only two psps embedded in glass cabinets at the show though and no representatives to discuss further details. a sony representative told the bbc news website this was because sony did not consider it to be part of their ""consumer technology"" offering.

elsewhere at the show, there was a plethora of colour and plasma screens, including samsung's 102-inch (2.6 metre) plasma - the largest in the world. industry experts were also excited about high-definition technologies coming to the fore in 2005, with new formats for dvds coming out which will hold six times as much data as conventional dvds. with so many devices on the move there were a lot of products on show offering external storage, like seagate's 5gb pocket sized external hard drive, which won an innovation for engineering and design prize. more than 120,000 trade professionals attended ces in las vegas, which officially ran from 6 to 9 january.

1913,"qwest may spark mci bidding war

us phone company qwest has said it will table a new offer for mci after losing out to larger rival verizon, setting the scene for a possible bidding war.

mci accepted a $6.75bn (â£3.6bn) buyout from telecoms giant verizon on monday, rejecting a higher offer from qwest. qwest chairman richard notebaert sent a letter to mci's board on thursday saying that it plans to submit a new offer after examining verizon's bid. formerly known as worldcom, mci is a long-distance and corporate phone firm. snapping up mci would give the buyer access to a global telecommunications network and a large number of business-based subscribers. shares of mci were up more than 4% in electronic trading after the close of new york markets.

qwest said on wednesday that mci had rejected a deal worth $8bn.

the takeover would be the fifth billion-dollar telecoms deal since october as companies look to cut costs and boost client bases. earlier this month, sbc communications agreed to buy its former parent and phone trailblazer at&t for about $16bn. there may be concerns other than cash, however, especially as mci only emerged from bankruptcy protection last april. verizon is far bigger than qwest, has fewer debts and has built a successful mobile division. also, mci, while trading under the name worldcom, became the biggest corporate bankruptcy in us history after admitting that it illegally booked expenses and inflated profits. former worldcom boss bernie ebbers is currently standing trial, accused of overseeing an $11bn fraud. qwest, meanwhile, had to pay the securities and exchange commission $250m in october to settle charges that it massaged earnings to keep wall street happy.

1702,"rapper 50 cent scores chart first

rapper 50 cent has become the first solo artist to have three singles in the us top five in the same week.

his track candy shop remained at the top of the charts, while disco inferno crept up from six to five. 50 cent also appears on rap protege the game's song how we do, number four in the us but now outside the uk top ten. the pair had a recent dispute which saw the game thrown out of 50 cent's rap collective g-unit, accusing him of disloyalty in an ongoing feud.

50 cent, who burst onto the music scene in 2003, has had less success in the uk charts, with three singles making the top ten. his debut album, get rich and die tryin', narrowly missed out on becoming a uk chart topper.

but in the us, he headed the 2003 end of year charts for the album and r&b and hip hop artists. newcomer the game's debut reached the top of the charts five weeks ago, while 50 cent's second collection the masscre was released in the us at the end of last week. last may, r&b star usher scored a chart first, with three concurrent singles in the us top 10, a feat which was previously matched only by the bee gees and the beatles. the hit songs were taken from the 24-year-old's confessions album, which topped the american chart for eight weeks.

ex-chat show host robert kilroy-silk is to contest the derbyshire seat of erewash at the next general election.

labour's elizabeth blackman won the seat in 1997 and has a 6,932 majority. she says she will fight on her record ""as a hard-working constituency mp"". mr kilroy-silk announced his plans a day after launching his new party, veritas, the latin for truth. the east midlands mep, who quit the uk independence party, wants his new group to ""change the face"" of uk politics. his choice of election constituency quashes speculation that he would stand against defence secretary geoff hoon in ashfield, nottinghamshire. ukip won 31% of the vote in erewash in last june's european elections - with mr kilroy-silk among their candidates for the region. until 1997, erewash had been held by the tories since 1970. ms blackman said she was proud of the government's achievements in the area. she declined to give her view of mr kilroy-silk at this point.

on thursday, he told a london news conference that veritas would avoid the old parties' ""lies and spin"". he said ""our country"" was being ""stolen from us"" by mass immigration and promised a ""firm but fair"" policy on immigration. veritas says it hopes to contest most seats at the forthcoming general election but plans to announce detailed policies on crime, tax, pensions, health and defence over the next few weeks.

ukip leader roger knapman says he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk. labour campaign spokesman fraser kemp said veritas was joining ""an already crowded field on the right of british politics"". mr kilroy-silk was joined in the new venture by one of ukip's two london assembly members, damien hockney, who is now veritas' deputy leader.

ukip's chairman petrina holdsworth has said the group will just be a parody of the party the men have left. mr kilroy-silk quit ukip last week after months of tension as he vied unsuccessfully for the leadership of that party. he said he was ashamed to be a member of a ukip whose leadership had ""gone awol"" after the great opportunity offered by its third place at last june's european elections. ukip's leader, roger knapman, has said he is glad to see the back of mr kilroy-silk. ""he has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the [european] election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',"" he said. ukip officials also argue mr kilroy-silk has not been ""straightforward"" in attacking the party he once wanted to lead.

810,"campese berates whingeing england

former australian wing david campese has told england to stop whingeing in the wake of their defeat to ireland.

england coach andy robinson lambasted referee jonathan kaplan for costing them the game after disallowing tries from mark cueto and josh lewsey. but campese told bbc sport: ""robinson is living up to england's reputation as whingeing poms. ""stop going on about it as who really cares? they're acting like they're the first team to be cheated of a win.""

england are contemplating a complaint to the international rugby board after potential ""tries"" by cueto in the first half and lewsey late on were ruled out without recourse to the video referee. but campese added: ""scotland could have beaten france in the same way, but do you see them whingeing? ""basically, things didn't go england's way and, in typical fashion, they make more of it when they believe they've lost unfairly.""

england are second bottom in the six nations table following defeats by wales, france and ireland. but although campese admitted he was surprised about their current predicament, he insisted england were ""no longer world class"". ""england are beginning to realise that being world champions doesn't mean you deserve to win every game,"" he said. ""they lost a few key players and suddenly everyone's realised the ones on the fringes were not all that good in the first place. ""added to that, the senior players aren't standing up and they can't do anything when the pressure mounts.""

campese, a veteran of 101 international caps, said full-back jason robinson would now be the sole englishman in his world xv. robinson has been blamed for poor leadership in the tournament, while his coach has been castigated for appointing a full-back captain. ""i agree that you can't captain from full-back,"" said campese. ""you need someone in the thick of the action, and it's very hard to give orders from all the way back there. ""some people are leaders and some aren't. he's not but there's no one who stands out in england's pack - no clear-cut leaders."" campese, though, defended coach andy robinson, who he believes was the ""only choice"" after sir clive woodward's resignation.

but he blamed ""a lack of talent in the england camp"" for making the current coach look poor. england face a potential wooden spoon match against italy on 12 march. and the ex-wallaby added: ""if england lost that, they'd be in bloody turmoil. that said, i don't think they will."" campese has tipped wales to win both the six nations and grand slam come the end of the tournament. ""it's been a surprising tournament,"" he said, ""and maybe ireland have a little bit more talent overall. ""but playing at home is a major boost. and the possible grand slam decider at the millennium stadium will be just too much for the irish.""

68,"'debate needed' on donations cap

a cap on donations to political parties should not be introduced yet, the elections watchdog has said.

fears that big donors can buy political favours have sparked calls for a limit. in a new report, the electoral commission says it is worth debating a â£10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. it also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.

there were almost â£68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly â£12m of them from individual gifts worth more than â£1m. the rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. the commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. ""while we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,"" says its report. if there was to be a cap, it should be â£10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned â£56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.

even without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under â£200. it also suggests increasing state funding for parties to â£3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the house of commons, european parliament, scottish parliament, welsh assembly or northern ireland assembly. and it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. all local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog. and there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.

the report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from â£20m to â£15m. the commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. electoral commission chairman sam younger said: ""there is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. ""our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. ""the public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations."" he called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.

1266,"doors open at biggest gadget fair

thousands of technology lovers and industry experts have gathered in las vegas for the annual consumer electronics show (ces).

the fair showcases the latest technologies and gadgets that will hit the shops in the next year. about 50,000 new products will be unveiled as the show unfolds. microsoft chief bill gates is to make a pre-show keynote speech on wednesday when he is expected to announce details of the next generation xbox.

the thrust of this year's show will be on technologies which put people in charge of multimedia content so they can store, listen to, and watch what they want on devices any time, anywhere. about 120,000 people are expected to attend the trade show which stretches over more than 1.5 million square feet. highlights will include the latest trends in digital imaging, storage technologies, thinner flat screen and high-definition tvs, wireless and portable technologies, gaming, and broadband technologies. the show also includes several speeches from key technology companies such as intel, microsoft, and hewlett packard among others. ""the story this year remains all about digital and how that is completely transforming and revolutionising products and the way people interact with them,"" jeff joseph, from the consumer electronics association (cea) told the bbc news website. ""it is about personalisation - taking your mp3 player and creating your own playlist, taking your digital video recorder and watch what you want to watch when - you are no longer at the whim of the broadcasters.""

consumer electronics and gadgets had a phenomenal year in 2004, according to figures released by ces organisers, the cea, on tuesday. the gadget explosion signalled the strongest growth yet in the us in 2004. shipments of consumer electronics rose by almost 11% between 2003 and 2004. that trend is predicted to continue, according to cea analysts, with wholesale shipments of consumer technologies expected to grow by 11% again in 2005. the fastest-growing technologies in 2004 included blank dvd media, liquid crystal display (lcd) tvs, digital video recorders (dvrs), and portable music players. ""this year we will really begin to see that come to life in what we call place shifting - so if you have your pvr [personal video recorder] in your living room, you can move that content around the house. ""some exhibitors will be showcasing how you can take that content anywhere,"" said mr joseph. he said the products which will be making waves in the next year will be about the ""democratisation"" of content - devices and technologies that will give people the freedom to do more with music, video, and images. there will also be more focus on the design of technologies, following the lead that apple's ipod made, with ease of use and good looks which appeal to a wider range of people a key concern.

the cea predicted that there would be several key technology trends to watch in the coming year. gaming would continue to thrive, especially on mobile devices, and would reach out to more diverse gamers such as women. games consoles sales have been declining, but the launch of next generation consoles, such as microsoft's xbox and playstation, could buoy up sales. although it has been widely predicted that mr gates would be showcasing the new xbox, some media reports have cast doubt on what he would be talking about in the keynote. some have suggested the announcement may take place at the games developers conference in the summer instead. with more than 52% of us homes expected to have home networks, the cea suggested hard drive boxes - or media servers - capable of storing thousands of images, video and audio files to be accessed through other devices around the home, will be more commonplace. portable devices that combine mobile telephony, digital music and video players, will also be more popular in 2005. their popularity will be driven by more multimedia content and services which will let people watch and listen to films, tv, and audio wherever they are. this means more storage technologies will be in demand, such as external hard drives, and flash memory like sd cards. ces runs officially from 6 to 9 january.

ministers would not rule out scrapping the child support agency if it failed to improve, work and pensions secretary alan johnson has warned.

but he said replacing the controversial csa would be ""the nuclear option"". a report by the commons work and pensions committee called for the agency to be wound up unless it improved its service within weeks. chairman sir archy kirkwood said: ""if the agency cannot be rescued, then it must be replaced.""

the committee reached its conclusions after it found that nearly 250,000 cases have yet to be processed. it warned that it could be five years before the csa was ""fit for purpose"", describing it as ""a failing organisation"" and ""in crisis"" with parents facing payment delays and inaccurate maintenance calculations. the report urged the csa to draw up contingency plans, including the ""abandonment option"", to be presented to parliament by easter, in case the cs2 computer system could not be made to work.

and responding to calls for the agency to be scrapped, mr johnson told bbc radio 4's today programme: ""i certainly wouldn't rule out the nuclear option of moving to a completely new system. ""but i think the select committee would agree with me we would only do that when we were absolutely convinced that this system just isn't going to work.""

the mps launched their inquiry into the csa's performance after it became clear that, despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003, a backlog of claims was building up. the mps found the â£456m system from american it giant eds was ""nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied, disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate"". faced with the committee's criticism, the government has suspended its plan to cut the agency's staff by 25%. the csa has been surrounded in controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents.

it is currently chasing outstanding payments of more than â£720m, while a further â£947m has been designated as ""unrecoverable"".

michelle, a mother of twins, said she had not received a penny of the â£57 a week she should be receiving from her ex-partner and had faced an ""on-going battle"" with the csa. her forms have twice been lost in the post, she said. ""i don't receive correspondence, i don't receive phone calls, i have to chase them all the time,"" she said. theresa may, tory shadow work and pensions secretary, said: ""we have got to find a way that's going to ensure those payments get through to the people who are due them."" the agency's former chief executive doug smith quit last autumn claiming he was ""seriously disappointed"" with its performance. the committee said the national audit office should investigate why the eds system had gone so badly wrong. it blamed the agency's senior management for a ""multitude of problems"" within the agency, including for an apparent lack of training of frontline staff.

five public sector unions will hold private talks with deputy prime minister john prescott at labour's spring conference in gateshead. they want the government to withdraw regulations - due to be introduced in weeks - which would raise the pension age for council workers from 60 to 65. up to 1.4m workers could take part in a strike already earmarked for 23 march. however, all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said bbc labour affairs correspondent stephen cape. in four days, britain's biggest union unison will start balloting 800,000 local government workers on strikes. other public sector unions have pledged to follow. it is just weeks before new regulations are introduced to raise the pension age of local government workers.

the five unions meeting mr prescott want the government to withdraw these regulations. this would allow months of tough negotiations to follow, said our correspondent. but a spokesman for mr prescott warned that the changes to the local government pension scheme would have to go ahead in april. privately ministers believe this will be the ""less painful"" option, our correspondent added. the public and commercial services union (pcs) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. pcs leader mark serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. ""for a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,"" he said. ""if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. ""in the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable.""

unison's 800,000 workers, the transport and general workers' union's 70,000 and amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 march walkout. mr prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures last week. it is understood no deal was offered in that meeting but there was room for further negotiations.

918,"corry backs skipper robinson

england forward martin corry says jason robinson is the right man to lead the national team back to winning ways.

after losses to wales and france, critics have started to wonder whether robinson can captain from full-back. but corry has backed robinson, who was given the role after the injury to fly-half jonny wilkinson, ahead of this weekend's trip to ireland. ""jason is doing a tremendous job. every week my respect for him goes up,"" corry told bbc radio five live. ""he is an inspirational captain. when he talks with the squad he talks with a lot of sense. ""the players have a lot of respect for him. it's an honour to be in the england side and an honour to play under him.""

england are under immense pressure following their poor start to the year and victory is vital if they are to rescue their six nations campaign. but corry insists england are in the right frame of mind for the contest. ""there is apprehension going into every game,"" he added. ""but you have to use that fear and put it into a positive mindset. ""when the whistle goes on sunday, what has happened in the past does not count for anything.

""we have not performed but if we put in a performance on sunday then we can start turning results around. ""there are a lot of changes taking place with england and we are at the start of something. we have not got off to the greatest of starts but you need to experience the bad the before you can fully appreciate the good.""

a trip to lansdowne road is daunting at any time, especially against an ireland side that are flying high after two impressive wins. they are the form team of the tournament and are tipped to claim their first grand slam since 1948. but corry is relishing the prospect of taking on the irish in their own backyard. ""they are full of confidence and are playing a great team game,"" he said. ""the forwards are creating a great platform and they have explosive runners out wide. ""if you look at the team on paper, they have stars from one to 15. it's a huge task but it is a great opportunity for us. ""lansdowne road is a tremendous venue to play in and we have to use it to our advantage.""

897,"mourinho to escape fa charge

chelsea boss jose mourinho will not face any football association action over the comments he made after their carling cup tie with manchester united.

mourinho intimated that united boss sir alex ferguson influenced referee neale barry after the duo walked down the tunnel together at half-time. but an fa spokesman told bbc sport: ""we are not taking action over mourinho. ""we have looked at the comments and we have decided that no further action is required. that is the end of it."" mourinho was concerned that ferguson's conversation with barry was followed by an inconsistent display by the official. ""i see one referee in the first half and another in the second,"" said mourinho. ""if the fa ask me what happened, i will tell them. what i saw and felt made it easier to understand a few things.

""maybe when i turn 60 and have been managing in the same league for 20 years and have the respect of everybody i will have the power to speak to people and make them tremble a little bit. ""the referee controlled the game in one way during the first half but in the second they had dozens of free-kicks. it was fault after fault, dive after dive. ""but i know the referee did not walk to the dressing rooms alone at half-time. he should only have had his two assistants and the fourth official with him, but there was also someone else."" referees chief keith hackett believes mourinho should retract his comments about ferguson and barry as he believes the blues boss has questioned their integrity. ""i'm hoping he might reconsider his comments, unfortunately this is the nature of the game,"" said hackett. ""i don't want referees or myself getting in the psychological warfare between two managers. for the second leg we have an experienced referee, and we should be talking about the quality of that game rather than the refereeing. ""sometimes managers have grounds for comments, and i note that, but a referees integrity has been questioned, that is offensive and should be avoided. mr mourinho should look at the facts."" mourinho added that the match was entertaining for a goalless draw and insisted his team could still reach the final. ""it's 0-0, so if we win we go through and if we get a draw we go to extra time,"" he said. ""we have exactly the same chance we had before this game. ""we are confident of getting a result but we know what manchester united is, a footballing power. it'll be difficult for us, but also for them.""

2138,"orange colour clash set for court

a row over the colour orange could hit the courts after mobile phone giant orange launched action against a new mobile venture from easyjet's founder.

orange said it was starting proceedings against the easymobile service for trademark infringement. easymobile uses easygroup's orange branding. founder stelios haji-ioannou has pledged to contest the action. the move comes after the two sides failed to come to an agreement after six months of talks. orange claims the new low-cost mobile service has infringed its rights regarding the use of the colour orange and could confuse customers - known as ""passing off"".

""our brand, and the rights associated with it are extremely important to us,"" orange said in a statement. ""in the absence of any firm commitment from easy, we have been left with no choice but to start an action for trademark infringement and passing off."" however, mr haji-ioannou, who plans to launch easymobile next month, vowed to fight back, saying: ""we have nothing to be afraid of in this court case. ""it is our right to use our own corporate colour for which we have become famous during the last 10 years."" the easyjet founder also said he planned to add a disclaimer to the easygroup website to ensure customers are aware the easymobile brand has no connection to orange. the new service is the latest venture from easygroup, which includes a chain of internet cafes, budget car rentals and an intercity bus service. easymobile will allow customers to go online to order sim cards and airtime - which will be rented from t-mobile - for their existing handsets.

1300,"fast moving phone bugs appear

security firms are warning about several mobile phone viruses that can spread much faster than similar bugs.

the new strains of the cabir mobile phone virus use short-range radio technology to leap to any vulnerable phone as soon as it is in range. the cabir virus only affects high-end handsets running the symbian series 60 phone operating system. despite the warnings, there are so far no reports of any phones being infected by the new variants of cabir.

the original cabir worm came to light in mid-june 2004 when it was sent to anti-virus firms as a proof-of-concept program. a mistake in the way the original cabir was written meant that even if it escaped from the laboratory, the bug would only have been able to infect one phone at a time.

however, the new cabir strains have this mistake corrected and will spread via short range bluetooth technology to any vulnerable phone in range. bluetooth has an effective range of a few tens of metres. the risk of being infected by cabir is low because users must give the malicious program permission to download on to their handset and then must manually install it. users can protect themselves by altering a setting on symbian phones that conceals the handset from other bluetooth using devices. finnish security firm f-secure issued a warning about the new strains of cabir but said that the viruses do not do any damage to a phone. all they do is block normal bluetooth activity and drain the phone's battery. anti-virus firm sophos said the source code for cabir had been posted on the net by a brazilian programmer which might lead to even more variants of the program being created. so far seven versions of cabir are know to exist, one of which was inside the malicious skulls program that was found in late november. symbian's series 60 software is licenced by nokia, lg electronics, lenovo, panasonic, samsung, sendo and siemens.

290,"csa chief who 'quit' still in job

the head of the ""failing"" child support agency widely reported to have resigned three months ago is still at the helm of the troubled organisation.

doug smith's departure was announced by work secretary alan johnson on 17 november as mps grilled him over the agency's poor performance. his ""resignation"" was referred to by both tory and lib dem leaders during that day's prime ministers questions. officials now say he did not resign but will move on under civil service rules.

mr smith's departure was reported widely at the time as his shouldering the blame for the failings of the child support agency. in january the mps who make up the commons work and pensions committee published a highly critical report into the ""failing"" agency noting the chief executive ""has now left"" and hoping ""the new leadership will bring a fresh approach to what is a failing organisation"".

on that day's today programme mr johnson was asked why mr smith had been allowed to resign rather than be sacked. he replied: ""the chief executive decided it was time to move on, there is a new chief executive coming in."" it now emerges that the widespread belief mr smith, made commander of the order of the bath in the new year honours, had left, was wrong. a department for work and pensions spokeswoman confirmed mr smith was still in post and that he would continue in the job until a replacement was found. ""no date was ever given for doug smith's departure,"" she said adding that the post had been advertised.

tory work and pensions spokesman david willetts said families affected by csa failings would wonder why mr smith was still in his job three months after his departure was announced. the csa has been surrounded by controversy since its introduction in 1993 to assess and enforce child support payments by absent parents.

the work and pensions committee launched their inquiry into the csa's performance after it became clear that, despite the introduction of a simpler system of calculating maintenance payments for new cases in 2003, a backlog of claims was still building up. it is currently chasing outstanding payments of more than â£720m, while a further â£947m has been designated as ""unrecoverable"". the mps found american it giant eds' â£456m system was ""nowhere near being fully functional and the number of dissatisfied, disenchanted and angry customers continues to escalate"".

in november, when he surprised mps and the watching media by announcing mr smith's departure, mr johnson said: ""i should tell you that doug has decided that now is the time to stand aside and to allow a new chief executive to tackle the challenges ahead. ""doug has exceeded the four years that senior civil servants are now expected to remain in a particular post. ""so doug believes that we have reached the natural breakpoint at which he can hand over the reins."" lib dem sir archy kirkwood, who chairs the commons work and pensions committee, said that when mr johnson had announced mr smith was going he got the ""clear impression"" the csa chief was retiring though it had since emerged that was not the case, and he may be seeking new employment opportunities.

he added his committee was ""duty bound"" to allow the work and pensions secretary to get new management into place in the csa and it would be ""premature"" to say anything further on the issue at the moment. but committee member and tory mp nigel waterson said he was ""amazed"" mr smith was still in his job. ""when mr smith and the secretary of state came to give evidence, we were led to believe he was going shortly,"" he said. ""even if he was working out three months notice, he should have been clearing his desk by now."" asked on thursday about mr smith's position mr johnson told bbc radio 4's world at one he thought it was a ""non-story"". he added that he had been absolutely open when he announced mr smith's departure to the select committee and how people chose to interpret it was a ""different thing"". ""the major issue is have we got a new chief executive coming into this very important agency as quickly as possible and have we gone through the right selection process to make sure we've got the right people,"" he added.

fiat is to stop making six-cylinder petrol engines for its sporty alfa romeo subsidiary, unions at the italian carmaker have said.

the unions claim fiat is to close the fiat powertrain plant at arese near milan and instead source six-cylinder engines from general motors. fiat has yet to comment on the matter, but the unions say the new engines will be made by gm in australia. the news comes a week after gm pulled out of an agreement to buy fiat. gm had to pay former partner fiat 1.55bn euros ($2bn; â£1.1bn) to get out of a deal which could have forced it to buy the italian carmaker outright. fiat and gm also ended their five-year alliance and two joint ventures in engines and purchasing, but did agree to continue buying each other's engines.

2168,"enron bosses in $168m payout

eighteen former enron directors have agreed a $168m (â£89m) settlement deal in a shareholder lawsuit over the collapse of the energy firm.

leading plaintiff, the university of california, announced the news, adding that 10 of the former directors will pay $13m from their own pockets. the settlement will be put to the courts for approval next week. enron went bankrupt in 2001 after it emerged it had hidden hundreds of millions of dollars in debt.

before its collapse, the firm was the seventh biggest public us company by revenue. its demise sent shockwaves through financial markets and dented investor confidence in corporate america.

""the settlement is very significant in holding these outside directors at least partially personally responsible,"" william lerach, the lawyer leading the class action suit against enron, said. ""hopefully, this will help send a message to corporate boardrooms of the importance of directors performing their legal duties,"" he added. under the terms of the $168m settlement - $155m of which will be covered by insurance - none of the 18 former directors will admit any wrongdoing. the deal is the fourth major settlement negotiated by lawyers who filed a class action on behalf of enron's shareholders almost three years ago. so far, including the latest deal, just under $500m (â£378.8m) has been retrieved for investors.

however, the latest deal does not include former enron chief executives ken lay and jeff skilling. both men are facing criminal charges for their alleged misconduct in the run up to the firm's collapse. neither does it cover andrew fastow, who has pleaded guilty to taking part in an illegal conspiracy while he was chief financial officer at the group. enron's shareholders are still seeking damages from a long list of other big name defendants including the financial institutions jp morgan chase, citigroup, merrill lynch and credit suisse first boston. the university of california said the trial in the case is scheduled to begin in october 2006. it joined the lawsuit in december 2001alleging ""massive insider trading"" and fraud, claiming it had lost $145m on its investments in the company.

brian moore believes the england captain should not be a full-back.

jason robinson has led the team during their opening three defeats in the six nations tournament, in the absence of fly-half jonny wilkinson. the world champions have struggled since the retirement of former captain martin johnson, a lock forward. and former england captain moore told the bbc: ""full-backs are too far away from the action. that's not a reflection on robinson personally."" he added: ""i just think the point of influence needs to move closer to the pack - which is, after all, where games usually start and finish."" moore says a lack of cohesion in the forwards is one of the reasons why england have lost against wales, france and ireland in this year's tournament. ""assertiveness in the pack isn't there, we're not getting enough people into the breakdowns,"" he explained. ""wer'e not getting quick ball, which means the backs are being stifled. their creativity depends on quick ball and we're not getting that.""

with injuries depriving him of key players like wilkinson, coach andy robinson has given youngsters such as harry ellis and jamie noon a chance. and moore believes the last two games against italy and scotland are a good opportunity to experiment further. ""the problem is the players that are around to replace the icons which have been lost because of retirement and injury don't have the requisite experience,"" moore added. ""you can't do anything about that but play them. there are players who have been knocking on the door, it's time for them to be looked at in these last two games because there's nothing on them.

33,"blair backs 'pre-election budget'

tony blair has backed chancellor gordon brown's pre-budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the uk economy.

in a speech in edinburgh, the prime minister said thursday's report reinforced stability and opportunity. and that would be central to labour's next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced. mr brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.

he told bbc radio 4's today programme: ""no politician should make the mistake that john major and his colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are, they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing.

""that is not what politicians should do, it would not be responsible to do."" mr brown insisted his spending plans were ""affordable"" and he could afford to be optimistic because britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. mr blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the ""cornerstone"" of labour's programme.

in a speech at edinburgh's napier university, he said labour would publish over the next few months ""a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term"".

""in every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. all of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all,"" mr blair said. in his pre-budget report, mr brown surprised some city experts by forecasting uk growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year. many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated. carl emmerson, from the institute for fiscal studies, told bbc news: ""he thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will, in fact, be ok. we're not so sure."" david page, of investec securities, said: ""his forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of â£8bn is way too optimistic. ""it's going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets.""

conservative shadow chancellor oliver letwin said: ""i can't find a single economic forecaster from the imf to the institute of fiscal studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances.

410,"uk pledges â£1bn to vaccine effort

uk chancellor gordon brown has offered â£960m ($1.8bn) over 15 years to an international scheme aiming to boost vaccination and immunisation schemes.

in a speech, he called for action to reach the 2000 millennium declaration goals of halving global poverty and tackling child mortality rates. mr brown has just returned from a tour of african nations. the â£1bn commitment is part of a five-point plan on debt relief, trade, aid, education and health.

the chancellor was speaking at an event jointly organised by the uk's department for international development and the un development programme on wednesday. mr brown welcomed news that the bill gates foundation and norway are joining up to put an extra â£0.53bn ($1bn ) into the global alliance for vaccines and immunisation (gavi). britain, france, gavi and the gates foundation have drawn up proposals to apply the principles of the international finance facility (iff) to the area of immunisation. that could see donors making long-term, legally binding financial commitments which can then be used as collateral for raising extra funds from international capital markets. as well as pledging â£960m over 15 years to the immunisation iff, britain urged other donors to contribute.

if gavi could increase its funding for immunisation by an extra â£4bn ($7.4bn) over 10 years, then an extra five million lives could have been saved by 2015 and five million thereafter, mr brown argued. campaign groups including friends of the earth, the world development movement, and war on want said uk government policy on free trade was a major barrier to fighting poverty. war on want's john hilary said: ""compassionate rhetoric cannot disguise the reality of the government's neo-liberal policies. ""as long as mr blair and mr brown continue to push free trade and privatisation on developing countries, more and more people will be pushed deeper into poverty, not lifted out of it.""

tony blair is being urged to use all his negotiating powers to end poor countries' debt and double aid.

some 45 million children will die needlessly before 2015 and aid budgets are half their 1960 levels, oxfam says in a report, paying the price. the call comes as the prime minister prepares to assume the presidency of the g8 of top industrialised nations. ""as rich countries get richer, they're giving less and less. this scandal must stop,"" oxfam's barbara stocking said.

""the world's poorest children are paying for rich countries' policies in aid and debt with their lives. ""2005 offers the chance for an historic breakthrough, but unless world leaders act now the year will end in shameful failure,"" the charity's director added. the report said: ""for rich countries, providing aid to help to end global poverty is an obligation and a matter of justice, not an act of charity."" it also points out that in 1970 the g8 of top industrialised nations agreed to spend 0.7% of their incomes on aid. but 34 years later none of the organisations members have reached this target and many have not yet set a timetable, the report says.

it argues that the price of not investing in poor countries' sustainable development will be felt across the world. the report said: ""global poverty threatens our shared prosperity and security. ""environmental crises and natural disasters, disease and drug trafficking know no national borders. poverty heightens the likelihood of conflict and unrest. ""new threats to the peace and security of rich nations arise from poverty and gross inequalities. ""criminal and terrorist networks are more likely to operate where state institutions are weak.""

both the prime minister and chancellor gordon brown have called for urgent action to fight world poverty. mr blair, who has described africa as a ""scar"" on the world's conscience, has already said tackling world poverty would be one his g8 priorities along with climate change and the aids epidemic. mr brown has also pledged to write off the debt owed to britain by the world's poor nations. a spokeswoman for the department for international development said: ""the government had made a clear commitment to reaching 0.7% of gross national income for overseas development aid by 2013. ""if britain's proposal for an international finance facility were adopted, the objective of 0.7% could be achieved earlier, by 2008-09. ""these additional resources will be used to increase uk bilateral aid to africa to at least â£1.25bn a year by 2008 and spend at least â£1.5bn on hiv/aids related work over the next three years.""

five million visitors made the london gallery - which houses treasures like raphael's madonna of the pinks - the uk's most visited museum in 2004. it recorded a 13.8% rise in numbers and was the country's second most visited tourist attraction, behind blackpool pleasure beach. charles saumarez smith, the gallery's director, said he was ""delighted"". he said the number of visitors through the doors had boosted figures to pre-11 september 2001 levels. mr saumarez smith added that the pedestrianisation of trafalgar square, where the gallery is located, and strong temporary collections throughout 2004 had led to the strong performance.

""our 2004 exhibition programme of el greco, russian landscape in the age of tolstoy and raphael: from urbino to rome was particularly strong and exceeded all targets,"" he said. ""the exceptional quality of the paintings in our permanent collection is also huge draw for the public.

""with important exhibitions of the work of caravaggio, stubbs and rubens in place for 2005, i am confident that the gallery is set for another highly successful year,"" he added. the figures were prepared by the association of leading visitor attractions (alva).

2058,"japan's ageing workforce: built to last

in his twenties he battled tuberculosis for eight years, then went on to run his own clothing business before marrying in his late thirties. and the 101-year-old torao toshitsune has eaten raw fish pretty much every day throughout his life.

mr toshitsune is one of japan's 23,000 centenarians - a club that is growing by 13% annually, and where the oldest member is 114. at his neat osaka detached house, where he lives with one of his sexagenarian daughters, mr toshitsune keeps a regular routine of copying out buddhist sutras and preparing the traditional japanese tea ceremony. between tasks, this remarkably active senior citizen reveals what his next goal is: ""well, what's most important for me is to be japan's number one."" mr toshitsune wants to outlive everyone. and when it comes to longevity, japan, as a country, appears to be doing just that. women can expect to live until 85, men until 78, four years longer than americans and europeans.

on the outskirts of kyoto, 83-year-old yuji shimizu contemplates this phenomenon during a round of golf with his younger friends, who are in their seventies.

""i think this is because the food industry and the environment have improved,"" he remarks. ""on average, we can live longer."" whether it's the diet, or the traditional family structure where roles were clearly defined, or just something in the genes, japan's elderly are remarkable. but while life may be a game of golf for mr shimizu, his grandchildren have huge problems ahead. japan is the world's least fertile nation with childbirth rates of just two thirds of that in the us.

by 2007, japan's population is expected to peak at 127 million, then shrink to under 100 million by the middle of the century. this means 30 million fewer workers at a time when the number of elderly will have almost doubled.

""in the year 2050, if the birth rate remains the same people over 60 will make up over 30% of the population,"" explains shigeo morioka of the international longevity centre in tokyo. so how will japan's finances stay on track? after a decade of economic stagnation and huge deficit spending, the public sector debt is already about 140% of the country's gross domestic product (gdp), the highest rate among industrialised countries. the international monetary fund predicts that as the falling birth rate takes grip from 2010, the cost of running japan's welfare state will double to more than 5% of gdp, while current account balances will deteriorate by over 2%. but unfortunately, japan appears poorly prepared both financially and politically. glen wood, vice president of deutsche securities japan, asks; ""who's going to fund the pension fund for the next generation and indeed who are going to be the new japanese worker? ""who is going to build the economy, who are going to be the leaders? who are going to be the producers of the gdp going forward?"" one option is further welfare reform. another is immigration, possibly from the philippines and indonesia. but so far, any emerging policy appears restricted to a limited number of nursing staff.

standing next to tokyo harbour is a version of new york's statue of liberty. but, as yet, japan is not ready for an ellis island.

""japan has never really liked that option in its history and i think it's an option that's becoming more and more plausible and necessary,"" insists mr wood. in japan, as in europe which also faces a workforce decline, immigration is a very sensitive subject. but for the japanese economy, facing 8% fewer consumers by 2050 means slumping domestic sales of cars, hi-tech kit and home appliances, perhaps even another property crash.

of course the japanese could always have more children. the government is currently considering financial rewards for procreative couples similar to those in operation in australia. but there would be no pay back until 2030, when today's babies are taxpayers, and the demographic crisis, like in europe, starts to unfold in 2010. in contrast to japan - and of course the european union - the us population is expected to increase by 46% to 420 million by the middle of the century. although president bush must re-devise social security to take account of a 130% rise in america's over 65s, the imf foresees a positive contribution to the us current account balance from the combined forces of fertility and immigration.

some voices in japanese industry are calling for radical changes to the nature of the japanese labour market. they want a shift towards financial services, though doubts persist over the country's ability, let alone willingness, to move away from manufacturing. ""japan still has problems getting a viable banking system, let alone shifting their auto business or their semi-conductor business or the broad based tech manufacturing business overseas,"" says mr wood. japan can either drive some radical reforms or else run the risk of a vicious ageing recession. falling demand and a lower tax take could result in soaring budget pressures and a basket case currency. come 2020, japan could be more dependent on a shrinking workforce than any other industrialised power. there are fears that the world's number two economy is doomed to a permanent recession. but none of this is mr toshitsune's concern anymore. at 101, he chuckles that, he feels fine.

""it will be fundamental to keep cool in the difficult moments - in the key situations of the game."" kirwan has recalled the experienced cristian stoica at centre and drafted in david dal maso at open-side after star flanker mauro bergamasco was ruled out for the rest of the tournament. scotland have also made two changes, simon webster replacing simon danielli on the wing and simon taylor returning for his first test in a year, for injured flanker jason white. taylor's recovery from a serious knee injury is a major boost to scottish hopes. ""he is one of the world-class players in the tournament and you want them in your team,"" acknowledged williams.

the us federal bureau of investigation is warning that a computer virus is being spread via e-mails that purport to be from the fbi.

the e-mails show that they have come from an fbi.gov address and tell recipients that they have accessed illegal websites. the messages warn that their internet use has been monitored by the fbi's internet fraud complaint center. an attachment in the e-mail contains the virus, the fbi said. the message asks recipients to click on the attachment and answer some questions about their internet use. but rather than being a questionnaire, the attachment contains a virus that infects the recipient's computer, according to the agency. it is not clear what the virus does once it has infected a computer. users are warned never to open attachment from unsolicited e-mails or from people they do not know.

""recipients of this or similar solicitations should know that the fbi does not engage in the practice of sending unsolicited e-mails to the public in this manner,"" the fbi said in a statement. the bureau is investigating the phoney e-mails. the agency earlier this month shut down fbi.gov accounts, used to communicate with the public, because of a security breach. a spokeswoman said the two incidents appear to be unrelated.

123,"more reforms ahead says milburn

labour will continue to pursue controversial reforms if it wins a third term in power, the party's election chief alan milburn has said.

he pledged labour would encourage more people to achieve their aspirations. ""what we want is for more people to earn and own,"" mr milburn told bbc radio 4's today show. tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin called labour ""a brilliant machine for talking about things"" but said it did not deliver policies the country needs. meanwhile, the liberal democrats' president simon hughes said: ""new labour has lost people's confidence in a way old labour never did."" mr milburn told today that labour wanted policies which encouraged increased social mobility in britain.

pressed on incapacity benefits, he said the tax and welfare system must ""provide the right incentives to people"". ""no-one is talking about driving people into work but what we do know is there are one million people on incapacity benefit who want the opportunity to work, providing the right level of support is there for them"". however, backbench labour mp karen buck warned against proposed changes in such benefits. she told the today programme: ""if the policy is seen as being about how do you make the feckless poor go back to work then it is not going to work, on the one hand. and it is not going to improve our electoral chances on the other."" mr milburn also sought to draw a line under the controversy about reports of a feud between gordon brown and prime minister tony blair.

he stressed that mr brown would play the same role that he did in the last election. mr milburn gave more details of planned reforms in a speech to labour's fabian society, in which he also praised mr brown as one of the leaders of the party's reform process. in the speech, he backed choice in schools and hospitals, wider home ownership and changes to the welfare system. mr milburn insisted that government reform must continue. ""our task is to rebuild the new labour coalition around 'one nation politics' that recognise, while life is hard for many, all should have the chance to succeed,"" he said. ""there is a glass ceiling on opportunity in this country. in our first two terms we have raised it. in our third term we have to break it."" voters turned on the party when it failed to reform industrial relations in the 1960s, he also told his audience.

oliver letwin said the government had failed to deliver in any of the key public services, such as cleaner hospitals, discipline in schools and putting more police on the streets. he said ministers had not delivered cleaner hospitals, with 5,000 people dying from infections last year. new labour had failed on school discipline because it had not implemented serious reforms so that teachers could run schools, and which would give parents choice, he went on. for the lib dems, simon hughes said many pensioners are means tested for the money they needed and students who were told there wouldn't be tuition fees and more debt ""have been given exactly the opposite"". he added: ""under new labour, all households are still paying unfair council tax rather than a fairer alternative.""

860,"jones happy with henson heroics

wales fly-half stephen jones admitted he was happy to hand gavin henson responsibility for taking the match-winning kick against england.

jones had missed three earlier shots at goal when wales, 9-8 down, were awarded a long-range penalty with four minutes left in cardiff. ""i knew the percentages of gavin reaching it were far higher than me,"" jones said. ""when he said he wanted it, there were no problems."" jones had seen a long-range effort fall a whisker under the crossbar on the hour, before charlie hodgson put england in front with 10 minutes left. ""i looked at where it was and i knew i was going to struggle to make it,"" jones added. ""i said to gareth (thomas, the wales captain) 'this is touch and go.' it was out of my range and obviously gavin is phenomenal when it comes to distance. he was confident and fancied it. ""there were no questions that he'd miss it the way he was playing. he had a superb game."" jones was happy to hail henson's heroic contribution to wales' first win over england in cardiff since 1993. ""physically he's a specimen: he's a balanced player, he glides when he runs and obviously he's got a great kicking game as well,"" jones said.

""his defence was superb, he made some great hits and he had a great game. ""i'm glad he's welsh."" victory over england for the first time since 1999 will no doubt fuel expectations of what wales might achieve in this year's six nations. but they now face three away fixtures in italy, france and scotland before completing their campaign against ireland in cardiff. ""people all over the world want to see wales back at the top table of world rugby,"" said a proud coach mike ruddock. ""but we are not there yet. the next step is finding the consistency to get further wins. ""we have to travel this week and we can't afford to get too giddy about this result. ""we have got to be professional and keep focused on facing italy.""

none more so than henson, who can now expect to have the same sort of spotlight thrust upon him as the likes of jonny wilkinson and brian o'driscoll. the confident 23-year-old is undaunted by the prospect of dealing with such weighty expectations however. ""i'm the sort of player who likes pressure on me,"" he said. ""it makes me more concentrated and i think i perform better under more pressure. ""i set a high standard against england and i've got to back it up next week. ""two years ago when we played italy i wasn't involved and we lost, so we've got to put that right next week.""

362,"guantanamo pair's passport ban

the government has written to two of the british men freed from guantanamo bay telling them they will not be allowed passports.

a letter sent to martin mubanga said his british passport would not be issued in the light of evidence gathered against him by the us. this suggested he was likely to take part in action against uk or allied targets if he left britain, it said. an identical letter has been sent to feroz abbasi, the men's solicitor says.

it is not known whether the other two men released from the cuba detention camp in january - richard belmar and moazzam begg - have also received letters. the government is implementing the rarely used royal prerogative in order to withdraw the men's passports. it is only the 13th time the power has been used since 1947 - the last time was in 1976. the letter, from the home office, says: ""i am writing to inform you that on the basis of the information which has come to light during your detention by the united states, the home secretary considered that there are strong grounds for believing that, on leaving the united kingdom, you would take part in activities against the united kingdom, or allied targets.""

the home office said it could not comment on individual cases.

the liberal democrats say they suspect the move is part of a package of security measures agreed with the us in order for the men to be allowed home from guantanamo bay.

home affairs spokesman mark oaten also demanded assurances that the evidence against the men was not gained under torture. he added: ""the power should only be used in absolute extreme circumstances and i find it hard to believe that these conditions have been met this time."" he said the move also raised complex questions about the use of the royal prerogative. the liberal democrats have promised to raise the issue in parliament.

amnesty international uk also questioned whether the decisions had been based on ""torture evidence"" obtained at guantanamo bay. ""furthermore, we believe there should be an investigation into the role played by the uk in the detention of uk residents and nationals and possibly many others at guantanamo bay,"" said director kate allen. the men's solicitor, louise christian, has raised questions about whether the evidence was gathered through torture. but the pentagon told bbc news us policy ""condemns and prohibits"" torture and said there was no evidence that any british detainee was tortured or abused. mr abbasi, 23, from croydon, south london, was taken to guantanamo bay after being captured in afghanistan in 2001. mr mubanga, 29, from north london, was originally detained in zambia.
