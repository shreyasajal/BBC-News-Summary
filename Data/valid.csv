1770,"uk economy facing 'major risks'

the uk manufacturing sector will continue to face ""serious challenges"" over the next two years, the british chamber of commerce (bcc) has said.

the group's quarterly survey of companies found exports had picked up in the last three months of 2004 to their best levels in eight years. the rise came despite exchange rates being cited as a major concern. however, the bcc found the whole uk economy still faced ""major risks"" and warned that growth is set to slow. it recently forecast economic growth will slow from more than 3% in 2004 to a little below 2.5% in both 2005 and 2006.

manufacturers' domestic sales growth fell back slightly in the quarter, the survey of 5,196 firms found. employment in manufacturing also fell and job expectations were at their lowest level for a year.

""despite some positive news for the export sector, there are worrying signs for manufacturing,"" the bcc said. ""these results reinforce our concern over the sector's persistent inability to sustain recovery."" the outlook for the service sector was ""uncertain"" despite an increase in exports and orders over the quarter, the bcc noted.

the bcc found confidence increased in the quarter across both the manufacturing and service sectors although overall it failed to reach the levels at the start of 2004. the reduced threat of interest rate increases had contributed to improved confidence, it said. the bank of england raised interest rates five times between november 2003 and august last year. but rates have been kept on hold since then amid signs of falling consumer confidence and a slowdown in output. ""the pressure on costs and margins, the relentless increase in regulations, and the threat of higher taxes remain serious problems,"" bcc director general david frost said. ""while consumer spending is set to decelerate significantly over the next 12-18 months, it is unlikely that investment and exports will rise sufficiently strongly to pick up the slack.""

1629,"byrds producer melcher dies at 62

record producer terry melcher, who was behind hits by the byrds, ry cooder and the beach boys, has died aged 62.

the son of actress doris day, he helped write kokomo for the beach boys, which was used in the movie cocktail, earning a 1988 golden globe nomination. he also produced mr tambourine man for the byrds, as well as other his such as turn, turn turn. melcher died on friday night at his home in beverly hills, california, after a long battle with skin cancer. he joined columbia records as a producer in the mid-1960s, and also worked with gram parsons and the mamas and the papas.

earlier in his career, melcher had hits as part of duo called bruce & terry, with future beach boy bruce johnston, which evolved into the rip chords group. melcher also worked closely with his mother, producing the doris day show and helping to run her charitable activities. in 1969 his name became linked with the charles manson murders, which saw the deaths of actress sharon tate and four of her friends at a home which melcher once rented. rumours circulated that melcher - who knew manson - was the killer's real target, because he had turned him down for a record contract. but los angeles police discounted the rumours, pointing out melcher had moved to malibu, and manson knew of his new address.

805,"man city 0-2 man utd

manchester united reduced chelsea's premiership lead to nine points after a scrappy victory over manchester city.

wayne rooney met gary neville's cross to the near post with a low shot, which went in via a deflection off richard dunne, to put united ahead. seven minutes later, the unfortunate dunne hooked a volley over david james' head and into his own net. steve mcmanaman wasted city's best chance when he shot wide from three yards in the first half. in the opening 45 minutes united had looked unlikely to earn the win they needed to maintain any chance of catching chelsea in the title race. their approach play was more laboured than patient and they managed to fashion just one chance - a paul scholes header over the bar. and city seemed to be content to sit back and try and hit their rivals on the break as the game settled into a tepid pattern. only shaun wright-phillips appeared capable of interrupting the monotony, looking lively down the right and causing gabriel heinze problems.

wes brown also found wright-phillips to be a difficult opponent when the tricky winger embarrassed him near the touchline. wright-phillips' sublime skill and pace took him past brown and he delivered a pin-point centre to the feet of mcmanaman. but the former liverpool player demonstrated why he has never scored against united by side-footing the easy chance wide. john o'shea was forced off after an earlier clash with sylvain distin and cristiano ronaldo came on to replace him. he immediately caused ben thatcher some discomfort and looked set to inject some much-needed pace into the united attack. rooney was being well marshalled by dunne - but that was all about to change. after the break, united poured forward and there was a renewed urgency about their play. and when neville delivered a cross in a carbon copy of city's best first-half chance, rooney showed mcmanaman how to do it - even if he needed the help of dunne's leg. worse was to come for dunne, who had been having a fine match. on 75 minutes, he scored a horrible own goal when attempting to volley clear rooney's cross and united seemed home and dry. however, city did fight back and fowler missed another great chance from close range. and united keeper roy carroll saved well from kiki musampa. but united could have a had a third late on when substitute ryan giggs hit the post.

- manchester city boss kevin keegan: ""we had a great chance to take the lead and the first goal was always going to be crucial. ""we started off with a good tempo but then we allowed them to dictate the pace a bit too much. ""but we still had four good chances, two after we'd gone 2-0 down, the one mcmanaman missed was very similar to the one wayne rooney scored from."" 
 - manchester united boss sir alex ferguson: ""it wasn't our best performance of the last three months but i think we're deserved winners.

346,"kilroy-silk quits 'shameful' ukip

ex-chat show host robert kilroy-silk has quit the uk independence party and accused it of betraying its supporters.

the mep said he was ashamed to have joined the party, which he labelled as a ""joke"". he plans to stand in the next general election but refused to confirm he is setting up a new political party called veritas - latin for truth. ukip leader roger knapman said he would ""break open the champagne"", adding: ""it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye'."" however, he did say the ex-chat show host had been ""quite useful initially"". ""he has remarkable ability to influence people but, sadly, after the (european) election it became clear that he was more interested in the robert kilroy-silk party than the uk independence party so it was nice knowing him, now 'goodbye',"" mr knapman told bbc radio 4's today programme. mr knapman rejected the idea mr kilroy-silk posed a threat to ukip and queried why he had failed to confirm rumours he was starting a new political party.

mr kilroy-silk explained his reasons to his east midlands constituents at a meeting in hinckley, leicestershire. his decision came as ukip officials began a process which could have triggered mr kilroy-silk's expulsion. it marks the end of his membership of ukip after just nine months. it began with a flood of publicity which helped ukip into third place in last june's european elections but became dominated by rancour as he tried to take over the party leadership.

mr kilroy-silk accused his fellow ukip meps of being content with growing fat ""sitting on their backsides"" in brussels. he told bbc news 24: ""i tried to change the party, i nagged all the way through the summer to do things, to get moving because i thought it was criminal what they were doing, it was a betrayal."" mr kilroy-silk also told sky news there was ""masses of support"" for him to form a new party - something he has yet to confirm will happen.

ukip won 12 seats and 16.1% of the vote at the european elections on the back of its call for the uk to leave the european union in his speech, mr kilroy-silk says the result offered ukip an ""amazing opportunity"" but the party's leadership had done nothing and ""gone awol"". there were no policies, no energy, no vision and no spokespeople, he said. ""the party is going nowhere and i'm embarrassed with its allies in europe and i'm ashamed to be a member of the party,"" said mr kilroy-silk.

he said his conviction in britain's right to govern itself had not changed. he would continue that campaign outside ukip when he contested the general election in an east midlands constituency. reports of his new party plans have prompted a formal complaint to ukip's disciplinary committee for bringing the party into ""disrepute"". on thursday, the party challenged mr kilroy-silk to stand down as an mep so voters can get a genuine ukip candidate.

2080,"glazer makes new man utd approach

malcolm glazer has made a fresh approach to buy manchester united, which could lead to a bid valuing the premiership club at â£800m.

the us tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the united board with ""detailed proposals"", it has confirmed. mr glazer, who owns the tampa bay buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. his new offer is expected to contain substantially less debt. mr glazer has already had one takeover attempt turned down by the red devils and responded by using his 28.1% shareholding to vote off three board members last november.

man united had turned down the bid because it was based on a high level of borrowing. but newspapers have speculated recently that the tycoon had gained the support of leading banks to come up with a stronger and less debt-laden bid. last week, however, mr glazer issued a statement to the stock exchange distancing himself from a new bid.

meanwhile, united's chief executive david gill said in december that talks would not resume unless glazer came up with ""definitive proposals"". now the board has confirmed that the us bidder is back, with a statement issued on sunday reading: ""the board can confirm it has now received a detailed proposal subject to various preconditions which may form the basis of an offer. ""a further announcement will be made in due course.""

to succeed malcolm glazer will still need the approval of major shareholders john magnier and jp mcmanus, who own 28.9% of the club. but the irish duo have cut off talks with glazer over the proposed sale of their stake and have so far made no comment on his latest approach. united fans have reacted with anger at the announcement. they have vehemently opposed any proposed takeover by glazer since he first showed interest in the club in september 2003 and after sunday's announcement they vowed to fight on. ""we will fight tooth and nail to stop him whatever his offer says. we do not want him or anybody else taking over united,"" said mark longden of the independent manchester united supporters' association. ""the campaign against this proposed takeover will continue as it has done since glazer first showed interest in the club.""

1347,"court halts mark morrison album

premiership footballer and record company boss kevin campbell has gained a court injunction stopping r&b singer mark morrison from releasing an album.

the everton striker signed morrison to his fledging 2 wikid records label and claims he spent thousands of pounds producing his album innocent man. now he is attempting to prevent morrison releasing the album on monday through another label. but morrison vowed to ignore the order, saying ""no judge is gonna stop me"".

morrison, who is now as well known for his brushes with the law than his music career, rose to fame with the 1996 single return of the mack.

but the leicester singer has struggled to repeat its success following two spells in jail. one was for hiring a stand-in to complete his community service for possession of a stun gun and three-months following a nightclub fracas. he signed to mr campbell's label a year ago and has released one single, with the label saying the album was due for release on 24 january. but mr campbell said he learned that morrison planned to release the album through jet star, which is advertising it on its website. mr campbell said: ""i'm glad we were granted the injunction but i'm completely gutted that we have had to go that far. ""mark morrison was given everything he asked for by 2 wikid but it seems that he couldn't help but return to his old ways.

""i've worked hard to realise my ambition in football but had hoped that my future career would be in the music business. ""i have always dreamt of starting a record label but now mark morrison has spoilt that dream for me. there is no loyalty in this business - just greed.""

but morrison is determined the album will be released on monday. he said: ""the injunction is ludicrous. ""i signed a new deal with a new record company because i was not getting the support i needed from 2 wikid. ""i was with that label for a year and in that time released just one record, which was not properly promoted. he added: ""the whole world is waiting for this album and it will come out on december 27. no injunction or judge will stop it. the mack will return."" the case is set to be heard in the high court on 20 december.

1015,"uk gets official virus alert site

a rapid alerting service that tells home computer users about serious internet security problems is being launched by the uk government.

the service, it safe, will issue warnings about damaging viruses, software vulnerabilities and weaknesses on devices such as mobile phones. alerts tell people how the threats affect them and what they can do to avoid trouble and protect themselves. the service will be free and those who sign up can get e-mail or text alerts. the scheme is aimed at home users and small businesses. the government estimates it will issue security alerts about six to 10 times a year, based on previous experience of virus outbreaks. ""there is a clear need for easy-to-understand and simple independent advice for non-technically minded people who use computers either at home or at work,"" said home office minister hazel blears. ""the purpose of this new government service is to ensure computer users are aware of the risks involved and how to deal with them easily and effectively without causing alarm."" those signing up will only be told about the most serious security threats that have the potential to affect millions of people.

full-time staff are being employed to comb through the many hundreds of alerts issued each year by computer security firms to spot which ones have the potential to catch out a large number of people between alerts the service will occasionally send messages giving people advice about safe ways to use their computers and phones. ""it safe will take our technical expertise and use it to help home users understand the risks and keep their computer systems, mobile phones and a range of related consumer electronic items, safe,"" said roger cumming, director of the national infrastructure security coordination centre (niscc).

the niscc, which is running the service, also stressed that those signing up would still need to use anti-virus software, firewalls, and software updates to stay secure. warnings about security problems will tell people what the problem is, how it affects them and what they can do to avoid trouble. alerts will not be issued unless users can do something to protect themselves against the threat. this might include downloading an update from an anti-virus vendor or updating software to close loopholes and fix vulnerabilities. however no software patches or programs will actually be dispensed through the site. the alerts will tell people how to go about getting hold of patches from security firms. the niscc spokesman said the site and alerting service would stay in existence for as long as there were security bugs on home computers and other gadgets.

government statistics show that more than half of all uk households own a home computer. it was estimated that almost 13 million of these were able to access the internet in 2004. the launch comes as the number of viruses and other malicious programs in existence is reaching unprecedented numbers. in september 2004, the number of malicious programs circulating topped the 100,000 mark. some fear that this figure could hit 150,000 by september 2005. the creation of the national alert service follows similar efforts in the netherlands and us. the national alerting service for the netherlands (aka de waarschuwingsdienst) and the us national cyber alerting service also tell citizens of serious security threats.

13,"brown and blair face new rift claims

for the umpteenth time, tony blair and gordon brown are said to have declared all out war on each other.

this time the alleged rift is over who should take the credit for the government's global aid and debt initiatives, particularly in the wake of the tsunami disaster - an issue many hoped and believed was above such things. it dominated the prime minister's monthly news conference, which saw mr blair start in full irritation mode as he was forced to bat away question after question about his relationship with his neighbour. as he told journalists: ""i am not interested in what goes in and out of newspapers. there is a complete unity of purpose."" and he again heaped praise on mr brown saying he was doing a great job, and would continue doing it - although he would not commit to any job for mr brown after the election.

so why did he arrange his press conference at the last moment so it coincided with mr brown's long-arranged keynote speech on aid and debt, he was asked? by now mr blair had moved from irritation mode to his barely disguised fury setting. he snapped back that the hacks knew very well what the operational reasons were for the timing of his press conference. well, not really, as it happens.

and he repeated what a great man gordon was and how united they were, before again sneering that he took absolutely no notice of what went in and out of the newspapers, preferring to get on with the job of doing the best for the country and the world. although in the next breath he declared: ""i get increasingly alarmed by what i read in the newspapers"" before catching himself on and quickly adding: ""in so far as i read them of course."" he probably had good reason to be alarmed because the newspapers had been full of stories about the claimed open warfare between the two men.

as far as the timing of the prime minister's press conference is concerned, there are two options. the first is that it was a calculated attempt to upstage the chancellor and seize back the initiative on the big issue of the moment. if that is the case it suggests that even the fear of seriously negative newspaper headlines is not enough to stop the squabbling. the second option is that it was an unavoidable coincidence, which would suggest the government has lost its once-famed ability to strictly co-ordinate announcements - through the infamous downing street grid - to avert just such allegations.

either way, the effect was the same - to overshadow the big announcements of government policy on a hugely pertinent issue. and there had been previous suggestions that the new year had started with a fresh outbreak of the warfare between the two men. firstly, the prime minister insisted on wednesday that he had been intimately involved in the development of the proposals to get g8 countries to freeze debt repayments from the tsunami-hit countries. it was claimed he had been embarrassed by the fact that gordon brown appeared to have taken the initiative over the government's response to the disaster while mr blair was still on holiday in egypt.

then, as if to pour fuel on the flames, both men separately spoke about working on tsunami or wider aid and development policy with their cabinet colleagues foreign secretary jack straw, aid minister hilary benn and deputy prime minister john prescott - without mentioning the other. all this came amid fresh claims that mr brown was still seething that he had been excluded from a prominent role in general election planning and had, as a result, started to set out his own platform. the fact that he used an article in the guardian newspaper to set out what he believed ""should"" be in the manifesto, has embarked on a mini tour of britain to set out his aid plans and will next week visit africa on the same mission - often seen as the prime minister's ""turf"" - has only added to the impression of rival camps operating entirely independently of each other. the prime minister denied all that as well, repeating his insistence that it was inconceivable the economy and the chancellor would not be at the centre of the election campaign. but the big fear with many on the labour benches now is that, unless a lid can be put on the speculation over the rivalry, it may even threaten to undermine the election campaign itself.

1832,"nigeria to boost cocoa production

the government of nigeria is hoping to triple cocoa production over the next three years with the launch of an ambitious development programme.

agriculture minister adamu bello said the scheme aimed to boost production from an expected 180,000 tonnes this year to 600,000 tonnes by 2008. the government will pump 154m naira ($1.1m; â£591,000) into subsidies for farming chemicals and seedlings. nigeria is currently the world's fourth-largest cocoa producer.

cocoa was the main export product in nigeria during the 1960s. but with the coming of oil, the government began to pay less attention to the cocoa sector and production began to fall from a peak of about 400,000 tonnes a year in 1970. at the launch of the programme in the south-western city of ibadan, mr bello explained that an additional aim of the project is to encourage the processing of cocoa in the country and lift local consumption. he also announced that 91m naira of the funding available had been earmarked for establishing cocoa plant nurseries. the country could be looking to emulate rival ghana, which produced a bumper crop last year. however, some farmers are sceptical about the proposals.

1051,"cebit opens to mobile music tune

cebit, the world's largest hi-tech fair, has opened its doors in hanover for a look at the latest technologies for homes and businesses.

there are more than 6,000 exhibitors registered and about 500,000 visitors are expected to pass through the doors. third generation mobiles, the digital home and broadband are key themes at the show. camera phones will get better resolutions as vendors set out to prove that bigger is definitely better. samsung is set to steal some initial limelight with the launch of a 7-megapixel phone on the opening day.

the sch-v770 has some of the features of high-end digital single lens reflex cameras such as manual focus and the ability to attach a telephoto or wide-angle lens. camera phones are likely to prove an interesting battle ground at the show, said ben wood, principal analyst at research firm gartner. ""it is firmly established that cameras are an integral part of phones and now the technology arms race is on in terms of megapixels. there will be a certain amount of 'look how big mine is',"" he said. there will also be increasing focus on music-enabled mobiles. ""at 3gsm in cannes everyone went music mad and music is going to be a big theme for all the vendors at cebit,"" said mr wood. sony ericsson will use the fair to show off the w800 - its recently unveiled walkman branded phone - and there is speculation that motorola may unveil its rokr handset, widely tipped as the first to carry apple's itunes music software. apple and motorola announced they were getting together at the end of last year as a result of a long-standing friendship between motorola's chief executive ed zander and steve jobs.

some analysts think motorola may save the launch for ctia, a wireless show in america the following week, which could be a telling sign about how operators are coming to view the german tech fair.

""one of the interesting things is that cebit is clearly a show in decline,"" said mr wood. ""a lot of the big players, such as nokia, are pulling back saying it is hard to justify a big presence at all of the shows. it could be the last big year for cebit,"" he said. other themes include tv-enabled mobiles which are bound to create a buzz in the halls as vodafone unveils a prototype handset that can show live digital television. there has been a glut of recent headlines about mobile tv - french operators are teaming up, o2 is trialling a system in oxford, uk, and nokia begins trialling a system in finland with the finnish broadcasting company, yle tv and commercial tv channels. cebit could become the battleground for the two competing methods for getting tv on to mobiles, and is also likely to provide a stage for a technology slated to compete with 3g. hsdpa (high speed downlink packet access) has been described as ""3g on steroids"" and could offer consumers much faster download times. for instance, a song which currently takes one and a half minutes to download to a phone could be done in 10 seconds. korean giants lg electronics and samsung will show off hsdpa handsets at the show and the technology is set to be rolled out in the us, europe and korea next year. broadband will continue to be a key theme at the show with internet telephony proving this year's killer application.

germany's largest online service provider, t-online, is tipped to reveal software for low-cost net telephony which would see it competing with its parent company deutsche telekom. cebit is used by many to unveil cutting edge products and in the mobile sphere this is likely to mean a lot of bright, colourful handsets as fashion continues to compete with technology when it comes to the device everyone has in their pockets. rainbow-coloured phones, influenced by handsets from japan, are just one example of how asian companies will stamp their mark on this year's show, at which they will have their biggest ever presence. cebit organisers have created a digital home in hall 25 of the 27 hangar-like buildings that will house the show. ""the digital home will be a hyped theme at the show. the house will be totally wired and full of things that can be used for home entertainment,"" said cebit organiser gabriele dorries.

515,"scotland 18-10 italy

six chris paterson penalties gave scotland victory in a dour but clinical encounter against italy at murrayfield.

coach matt williams' side were outmuscled and outplayed in a tense first half but led 6-3 at the break. paterson slotted four more second-half penalties and scotland were denied a try when wing sean lamont's touchdown was ruled out for a forward pass. a late andrea masi try was small consolation for italy, chasing their first away win in the six nations. scotland came out on top of the early exchanges and took a quick 3-0 lead through the boot of full-back paterson. but the more powerful azzurri pack eventually rumbled into life.

a series of drives into scottish territory set up a penalty attempt, missed by full-back roland de marigny, and a wayward drop-goal effort from luciano orquera. scotland defended the initial thrusts but on 20 minutes italy, after coming up yards short of the line, equalised through a de marigny penalty. italy were offered another penalty when scottish flanker simon taylor was offside but the left-footed de marigny pushed his kick wide. scotland finally made the most of a rare foray into the italian half and snatched three points from paterson when an italian forward handled the ball in a ruck.

as the half wore on, both sides squandered promising spells of momentum with sloppy penalties, and the period fizzled out with scotland numerically, if not psychologically, on top. italy's de marigny narrowly missed a chance to level the scores again shortly after the break but his long-range kick shaved the right upright. and scotland capitalised with a third paterson penalty on 50 minutes. williams' side seemed to have found a spark from somewhere and, after a couple of probing attacks, paterson was able to slot another three points to widen the gap.

with the pendulum of possession swinging towards scotland, lamont thought he had wriggled over in the left corner after 65 minutes but play was recalled for a marginal forward pass from paterson. another paterson penalty on 70 minutes kept the pressure on the wilting visitors. but john kirwan's men had the last laugh when gordon ross' attempted clearance was charged down and masi pounced for the try, converted by de marigny.

news corp, the media company controlled by australian billionaire rupert murdoch, is eyeing a move into the video games market.

according to the financial times, chief operating officer peter chernin said that news corp is ""kicking the tyres of pretty much all video games companies"". santa monica-based activison is said to be one firm on its takeover list. video games are ""big business"", the paper quoted mr chernin as saying. we ""would like to get into it"".

the success of products such as sony's playstation, microsoft's x-box and nintendo's game cube have boosted demand for video games. the days of arcade classics such as space invaders, pac-man and donkey kong are long gone. today, games often have budgets big enough for feature films and look to give gamers as real an experience as possible. and with their price tags reflecting the heavy investment by development companies, video games are proving almost as profitable as they are fun.

mr chernin, however, told the ft that news corp was finding it difficult to identify a suitable target. ""we are struggling with the gap between companies like electronic arts (ea), which comes with a high price tag, and the next tier of companies,"" he explained during a conference in phoenix, arizona. ""these may be too focused on one or two product lines."" activision has a stock market capitalisation of about $2.95bn (â£1.57bn), compared to ea's $17.8bn. some of the games industry's main players have recently been looking to consolidate their position by making acquisitions. france's ubisoft, one of europe's biggest video game publishers, has been trying to remain independent since electronic arts announced plans to buy 19.9% of the firm. analysts have said that industry mergers are likely in the future.

1895,"fao warns on impact of subsidies

billions of farmers' livelihoods are at risk from falling commodity prices and protectionism, the un's food & agriculture organisation has warned.

trade barriers and subsidies ""severely"" distort the market, the fao report on the ""state of agricultural commodity markets 2004"" said. as a result, the 2.5 billion people in the developing world who rely on farming face food insecurity. the most endangered are those who live in the least-developed countries. the fao report said that support for farmers in industrialised nations was equivalent to 30 times the amount provided as aid for agricultural development in poor countries.

the fao has urged the world trade organisation to swiftly conclude negotiations to liberalise trade, easing developing countries' access to the world market. it also criticised the high tariffs imposed by both developed and developing nations. it recommends that developing countries reduce their own tariffs to encourage trade and take advantage of market liberalisation.

according to the organisation, subsidies and high tariffs have a strong impact on the trade of products such as cotton and rice. global exports of these products are mainly in the hands of the european union and the us, who - thanks to subsidies - sell them at very low prices. in fact, almost 30 wealthy nations spend more than $300bn (â£158.8bn; 230.9bn euros) in agricultural subsidies. the market situation has divided developing nations in two groups, the fao said. the first group have a reasonably diverse range of agricultural products while in the second group, agriculture lies largely in the hands of small-scale producers. for 43 developing countries, more than 20% of their export incomes come from the sale of just one product. these countries are mainly situated in sub-saharan africa, latin america and the caribbean.

the football association will take no action against chelsea boss jose mourinho following his sending-off in sunday's carling cup final.

118,"uk rebate 'unjustified' - chirac

french president jacques chirac has called the uk's â£3bn rebate from the european union ""unjustified"".

speaking after a summit meeting he said unless it was put up for discussion the eu would never be able to reach agreement on its medium term finances. earlier foreign secretary jack straw said the uk was prepared to veto any bid to reduce the rebate secured by margaret thatcher in 1984. he said it remained justified because less eu farm money came to the uk.

mr chirac told reporters in brussels: ""one can only have a reasonable budgetary balance if we put back on the table the british cheque. it can no longer be justified. it was from the past."" but a uk government official responded: ""even with the rebate, the uk pays two and a half times more than france contributes to the eu budget. without it we would pay 14 times as much as france. ""there can be no deal on future financing which does not protect the rebate.""

the 25-member eu is gearing up for tough negotiations on its budget plans for the period 2007-2013, with the bloc's luxembourg presidency hoping to strike a deal at a june summit. earlier conservative graham brady said the rebate was a ""crucial test"" of how firmly ministers were prepared to stand up for britain. eu commission president jose manuel barroso has indicated he wants the rebate to come to an end. mr straw said that as well as the veto over the rebate the uk wanted to keep a tight rein on national contributions.

the uk, france, germany, austria, the netherlands and sweden want the eu budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the european commission has urged an increase to 1.26%. mr straw has said the eu commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget. shadow europe minister mr brady said: ""i believe it is essential that britain keeps the rebate and i think it's a crucial test of how firmly the british government is prepared to stand up for britain internationally in europe.

""the uk is already one of the biggest net contributors to the eu ."" the foreign secretary meanwhile said the ""justice"" of the rebate remained. ""we have one of the lowest net receipts of any eu country because of the relatively small size of our agriculture sector and its efficiency. ""that continues to be the case.""

uk independence party leader roger knapman said the rebate was ""set in stone"" and there was no reason to negotiate about it. ""it is extraordinary to do it at this time, just as we are becoming the biggest contributor to the eu. if we lose our rebate as well, the british taxpayer is going to be bled at such a rate that i think everyone will go off the european project."" eu leaders are holding talks in brussels on how to re-energise the sluggish european economy. uk prime minister tony blair is meeting his eu counterparts to finalise a package of measures aimed at stimulating growth and boosting employment ahead of a series of referendums on the european constitution. the plans could introduce a free market into everything from computer services to construction. critics - including germany and france - believe liberalisation could result in companies shifting staff to cheaper bases in eastern europe, undercutting large eu economies and undermining social protections. there are also concerns about the number of workers from eastern european countries who will head west, exacerbating the already high unemployment levels in germany.

mr straw insisted there was nothing to fear from the services directorate. ""european countries overall have benefited hugely from the free market in goods,"" he said. ""what we are now talking about is developing that market into an internal market in services."" britain's low unemployment meant there was less ""neurosis"" about people coming from eastern european countries. ""in countries like germany and france, where frankly because of a tighter social market they have much higher levels of unemployment, there is increasing anxiety about other people coming in,"" he said.

391,"blair blasts tory spending plans

tony blair has launched an attack on conservative spending plans, saying they are a ""ludicrous improbability"".

the prime minister has told a labour party gathering that the tory policies would cause economic failure. tory leader michael howard has said his party would cut â£35bn in ""wasteful"" spending to allow â£4bn in tax cuts. on saturday, tory shadow home secretary david davis said the tories would fund the cuts by removing ""inefficiencies"" which had ""burgeoned"" under labour. in his speech, mr blair contrasted a reformed labour party, which had learned to occupy the political centre ground, with a hidebound tory party, which he said would turn the clock back with spending cuts. mr blair said: ""the conservative tax and spending proposals would put at risk, both britain's hard-won economic stability - the lowest mortgages, inflation, unemployment, for decades - and the key investment in public services.

""i believe that the tory plans are as plain a call to return to the past as it's possible to imagine,"" he said. ""it's a recipe for exactly the same boom and bust economics and cuts in public services that were their hallmark in 18 years of conservative government."" mr blair added: ""they, the conservatives have learned nothing."" by contrast, he said, new labour had listened to its electorate and changed.

mr blair went on to list his government's achievements and to issue a rallying call to the party. ""so now we have a choice, we can defend this record and we can build on it and go on and fulfil the promise or give up and go back. and i say we have to fight."" in response, david davis said the tories would make cuts, such as removing regional assemblies, but would bring in more police officers and match labour's spending on health and education. ""everybody knows, having lived through this government the last seven years, that they faced lots of stealth tactics, lots of increases in taxes, but no improvement in public services,"" he said. mr davis said labour had been responsible for ""huge waste, huge overspending, not on the frontline at all but on bureaucracy"". ""the public face a choice between more waste and more taxes with this government, less waste and lower taxes with a tory government,"" he concluded.

gordon brown has addressed the conference behind closed doors. the chancellor said the conservatives' plans would see some â£50bn in spending cuts by 2011, which the tories deny. mr brown also issued call for party unity and warn of the dangers of allowing themselves to be ""distracted or diverted"". according to an advance text released by officials, he told delegates: ""we must all show the strength and unity of purpose to take the long-term decisions necessary to meet them.""

mr brown warned that the tories were planning ""the biggest cuts ever in the history of any election manifesto"". meanwhile, tory shadow chancellor oliver letwin accused mr blair of ""misrepresenting"" the party's proposals and questioned how labour would fund its own plans. ""he still cannot accept the simple truth, which is that we will spend more on what matters to people - schools, hospitals and police - and that we will offer value for money and lower taxes,"" mr letwin said. ""once again mr blair and his chancellor have failed to answer the question that lies at the heart of this election - which taxes will they put up to fill the â£8bn shortfall in their plans?""

senior officials at the two bodies generating private income for the queen and prince of wales are to be questioned by mps.

aides from the duchy of lancaster and duchy of cornwall will appear before the commons public accounts committee. it has been reported they could be questioned about prince charles' spending on camilla parker bowles. but bbc correspondent peter hunt said they are not responsible for how money is spent and may be unable to answer. duchy officials, who will appear before the committee on monday, are only responsible for generating money. the duchy of lancaster provides the queen's private income, while the duchy of cornwall provides prince charles' annual income. the duchy of cornwall is a 140,000-acre estate across 25 counties, and also includes residential properties, shops, offices, stocks and shares. it was set up in 1337 by king edward iii to provide income for successive heirs to the throne. it covers the cost of the prince's public and private life - neither charles, nor william and harry, receive taxpayers' money from the civil list. however, the prince of wales did receive over â£4m from government departments and grants-in-aid in 2003-4. the duchy last year generated almost â£12m. the prince has voluntarily paid income tax - currently 40% - since 1993.

86,"could rivalry overshadow election?

tony blair and gordon brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle.

along with any number of senior cabinet colleagues, they are insisting their only job is to win the next election and govern in the best interests of britain. it is a message they are aiming directly at their backbenchers who are becoming irritated and even unnerved by the continuing claims and counter claims surrounding this alleged rift. ian gibson, for example, urged the two men to stop squabbling, declaring: ""for goodness sake, sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can."" those with slim majorities are particularly fearful that the rift could hit their own hopes of re-election. tony blair will seek to reassure labour mps on monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at westminster - a behind-closed doors meeting which gordon brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity.

meanwhile the likes of health secretary john reid and labour peer lord haskins are warning of the electoral dangers of allowing this soap opera to continue. and they have both warned the rival camps to stop spreading the poison. lord haskins even suggested mr blair should reinstate mr brown as the central figure in the election planning.

but this particular genie is unusually reluctant to return to captivity and many fear it is simply too late to repair the damage. they believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears. and it matters little whether the rift is real or, as some try to suggest, simply the product of newspaper headlines and westminster gossip. few in westminster actually believe that, simply because the evidence appears to contradict it.

for example, the weekend's attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick. even as they were both insisting on their unity of purpose and claiming they would not be swayed by newspaper stories, they still managed to stir the speculation with their comments.

mr blair talked about the ""new"" labour manifesto - a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor, who has long rejected the label. and mr brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year. that claim was repeated in robert peston's book, a book which amply demonstrates this corrosive downing street soap opera is nowhere near its final act.

for his part, mr brown insists his only motivation was to get labour re-elected.

the trouble is, both men have fallen short of offering simple, straightforward denials of the central claims. so they have both been accused of actually making matters worse by feeding the speculation with their own behaviour. the first thing to be said is that these suggestions have not come from nowhere. they started with and are sustained by ""friends"" of the two men. one only had to listen to the chancellor's friend and former spin chief charlie whelan last week to understand that there is a real anger from this camp at the prime minister's apparent attempts to confound mr brown's leadership ambitions. but it is not just public pronouncements from ex-aides.

there are whispered briefings to selected journalists from both sides. it is no secret in westminster, for example, that downing street believes the chancellor is indulging in a mammoth sulk and acting in a petty and deliberately provocative manner.

then there are the actions of the men themselves. gordon brown sets out what is seen as a rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign. the prime minister responds by scheduling his monthly press conference to clash with a keynote speech by the chancellor. meanwhile large numbers of backbench mps insist voters are either entirely uninterested in the chatter, which they believe is a media-only obsession, or that they fear for the efficient running of a government beset by such rivalry. either way, there is universal agreement that if this goes on through the general election it can only do the labour party serious damage. there are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation. but with probably only four months to the next election, that looks like being a particularly difficult trick to pull off.
","lord haskins even suggested mr blair should reinstate mr brown as the central figure in the election planning.they believe they will be fighting the next election with the sounds of open warfare between the two men ringing in their ears.tony blair will seek to reassure labour mps on monday evening at their first meeting of the new year at westminster - a behind-closed doors meeting which gordon brown is thought likely to also attend to show unity.and mr brown pointedly refused to deny claims the prime minister had reneged on a deal to hand him the premiership last year.for his part, mr brown insists his only motivation was to get labour re-elected.there are signs that the two men appreciate the dangers and both want to put a lid on all the speculation.then there are the actions of the men themselves.they started with and are sustained by ""friends"" of the two men.mr blair talked about the ""new"" labour manifesto - a move which seemed calculated to irritate the chancellor, who has long rejected the label.for example, the weekend's attempts by both men to play down the divisions failed to do the trick.ian gibson, for example, urged the two men to stop squabbling, declaring: ""for goodness sake, sometimes you have to rise above petulance and make sure that you do your job as effectively as you can.""few in westminster actually believe that, simply because the evidence appears to contradict it.tony blair and gordon brown are desperately trying to stuff the genie of their rivalry back into the bottle.gordon brown sets out what is seen as a rival manifesto then appears to embark on his own personal campaign.",politics,748,275

1370,"musicians to tackle us red tape

musicians' groups are to tackle us visa regulations which are blamed for hindering british acts' chances of succeeding across the atlantic.

a singer hoping to perform in the us can expect to pay $1,300 (â£680) simply for obtaining a visa. groups including the musicians' union are calling for an end to the ""raw deal"" faced by british performers. us acts are not faced with comparable expense and bureaucracy when visiting the uk for promotional purposes.

nigel mccune from the musicians' union said british musicians are ""disadvantaged"" compared to their us counterparts. a sponsor has to make a petition on their behalf, which is a form amounting to nearly 30 pages, while musicians face tougher regulations than athletes and journalists. ""if you make a mistake on your form, you risk a five-year ban and thus the ability to further your career,"" says mr mccune.

""the us is the world's biggest music market, which means something has to be done about the creaky bureaucracy,"" says mr mccune. ""the current situation is preventing british acts from maintaining momentum and developing in the us,"" he added.

the musicians' union stance is being endorsed by the music managers' forum (mmf), who say british artists face ""an uphill struggle"" to succeed in the us, thanks to the tough visa requirements, which are also seen as impractical. the mmf's general secretary james seller said: ""imagine if you were an orchestra from the orkneys? every member would have to travel to london to have their visas processed.""

""the us market is seen as the holy grail and one of the benchmarks of success, and we're still going to fight to get in there. ""it's still very important, but there are other markets like europe, india and china,"" added mr seller. a department for media, culture and sport spokeswoman said: ""we're aware that people are experiencing problems, and are working with the us embassy and record industry to see what we can do about it."" a us embassy spokesman said: ""we are aware that entertainers require visas for time-specific visas and are doing everything we can to process those applications speedily."" ""we are aware of the importance of cultural exchange and we will do our best to facilitate that,"" he added.

389,"woolf murder sentence rethink

plans to give murderers lighter sentences if they plead guilty have been watered down.

there was an outcry three months ago when the sentencing guidelines council - led by lord woolf - published its proposals for england and wales. it had suggested judges should reduce sentences by a third for murderers who confessed at the earliest opportunity. but that has now been changed to one-sixth, with no reduction for those killers given a ""whole life tariff"". at the time lord woolf, the lord chief justice, had said the one third reduction would only be in extraordinary circumstances - for example, if people gave themselves up before their crime had even been detected. the guidelines were to recognise the need to spare victims and witnesses the trauma of going to court where possible, by allowing lighter sentences for guilty pleas and co-operation, he said.

but director of the victims of crime trust, norman brennan, accused lord woolf of having an ""arrogant contempt for victims of crime and the law-abiding public"". the national association of probation officers said the move would be ""political suicide"". in revised proposals from the sentencing guidelines council (sgc), the section on murder said possible reductions would have to be ""weighed carefully"" by a judge so they did not lead to ""an inappropriately short sentence"". where it was appropriate to reduce the minimum term having regard to a plea of guilty, the maximum reduction would be one sixth, and should never exceed five years, it said.

in a statement issued on wednesday lord woolf said: ""i have no doubt that being able to call on the diverse backgrounds and experiences of all those that serve on the sgc has vastly improved the final guidelines. ""i am confident, as a result, that judges will be better placed to deliver sentences which are effective both as punishments and deterrents to offending and reoffending."" director of public prosecutions, ken macdonald qc, who sits on the sgc, said the principle of discounting sentences to offenders for early guilty pleas is set down by parliament. ""what the new guideline on reduced sentences for guilty pleas does is increase the chances of convicting the guilty by bringing clarity to this process. ""it represents a tougher regime than existed previously, because the discount is automatically reduced if a guilty plea is not made at the first available opportunity,"" he said.

the us dollar has continued its record-breaking slide and has tumbled to a new low against the euro.

investors are betting that the european central bank (ecb) will not do anything to weaken the euro, while the us is thought to favour a declining dollar. the us is struggling with a ballooning trade deficit and analysts said one of the easiest ways to fund it was by allowing a depreciation of the dollar. they have predicted that the dollar is likely to fall even further.

the us currency was trading at $1.364 per euro at 1800 gmt on monday. this compares with $1.354 to the euro in late trading in new york on friday, which was then a record low.

the dollar has weakened sharply since september when it traded about $1.20 against the euro. it has lost 7% this year, while against the japanese yen it is down 3.2%. traders said that thin trading levels had amplified monday's move. ""it's not going to take much to push [the dollar] one way or the other,"" said grant wilson of mellon bank. liquidity - a measure of the number of parties willing to trade in the market - was about half that of a normal working day, traders said.

world cup winners lawrence dallaglio, neil back and martin johnson had all been thought to be in the frame for next summer's tour to new zealand. ""i don't think you can ever say never,"" said woodward. ""but i would have to have a compulsive reason to pick any player who is not available to international rugby."" dallaglio, back and johnson have all retired from international rugby over the last 12 months but continue to star for their club sides. but woodward added: ""the key thing that i want to stress is that i intend to use the six nations and the players who are available to international rugby as the key benchmark. ""my job, along with all the other senior representatives, is to make sure that we pick the strongest possible team. ""if you are not playing international rugby then it's still a step up to test rugby. it's definitely a disadvantage.

""i think it's absolutely critical and with the history of the lions we have got to take players playing for the four countries."" woodward also revealed that the race for the captaincy was still wide open. ""it is an open book,"" he said. ""there are some outstanding candidates from all four countries."" and following the all blacks' impressive displays in europe in recent weeks, including a 45-6 humiliation of france, woodward believes the three-test series in new zealand will provide the ultimate rugby challenge. ""their performance in particular against france was simply awesome,"" said the lions coach. ""certain things have been suggested about the potency of their front five, but they're a very powerful unit."" with his customary thoroughness, woodward revealed he had taken soundings from australia coach eddie jones and jake white of south africa following their tour matches in britain and ireland.

as a result, woodward stressed his lions group might not be dominated by players from england and ireland and held out hope for the struggling scots. ""scotland's recent results have not been that impressive but there have been some excellent individual performances. ""eddie in particular told me how tough they had made it for australia and i will take on board their opinions."" and scotland forward simon taylor looks certain to get the call, provided he recovers from knee and tendon problems.

the south african government has put tax cuts and increased social spending at the centre of its latest budget.

aiming to both stir economic growth and aid the country's poor, finance minister trevor manuel said the focus of the 2005 budget was ""more for all"". the tax cuts target firms and individuals, cutting corporate tax from 30% to 29% and offering income tax cuts worth 6.8bn rand ($1.2bn; â£910m). spending on health and education will rise by 9.4% and 8.1% respectively. spending on housing and sanitation will rise by 12%. all the spending increases will run over the next three years.

unveiling the 418bn-rand budget to parliament, mr manuel said the south african economy had grown by an average of 3.2% over the past four years, slightly below the african average of 4%.

he predicted that the south african economy would grow by 4.3% in 2005 and 4.2% in 2006. mr manuel added that inflation fell to 4.3% in 2004 and is expected to remain at between 3% and 6% from now until at least 2008, helped by interest rates which are at their lowest level in 24 years. given that both corporate and personal taxes are being cut - under the new measures, those earning less than 35,000 rand a year will be exempt from income tax - the extra 22.3bn rand in social spending will be partly met by higher fuel, tobacco and alcohol taxes.

""in this budget, the focus is on more for all, not more for some, and not a hell of a lot more for a few, but spread across all of south africa,"" said mr manuel. he said that the economic situation was a ""marked improvement"" on the position at the end of apartheid, but acknowledged that more needed to be done to improve the lives and livelihoods of the disadvantaged. about 280,000 jobs a year have been created in south africa since 2000 but unemployment remains high, currently close to 30%. economist colen garrow said the budget looked as if it would stimulate economic growth. ""it's pleasant to see the cut in company taxes, it's a good incentive for business,"" he said.

the world's biggest confectionery firm, cadbury schweppes, has reported a modest rise in profits after the weak dollar took a bite out of its results.

underlying pre-tax profits rose 1% to â£933m ($1.78bn) in 2004, but would have been 8% higher if currency movements were stripped out. the owner of brands such as dairy milk, dr pepper and snapple generates more than 80% of its sales outside the uk. cadbury said it was confident it would hit its targets for 2005. ""while the external commercial environment remains competitive, we are confident that we have the strategy, brands and people to deliver within our goal ranges in 2005,"" said chief executive todd stitzer.

the modest profit rise had been expected by analysts after the company said in december that the poor summer weather had hit soft drink sales in europe.

cadbury said its underlying sales were up by 4% in 2004. growth was helped by its confectionery brands - including cadbury, trident and halls - which enjoyed a ""successful"" year, with like-for-like sales up 6%. drinks sales were up 2% with strong growth in us carbonated soft drinks, led by dr pepper and diet drinks, offset by the weaker sales in europe. cadbury added that its fuel for growth cost-cutting programme had saved â£75m in 2004, bringing total cost savings to â£100m since the scheme began in mid-2003. the programme is set to close 20% of the group's factories and shed 10% of the workforce. cadbury schweppes employs more than 50,000 people worldwide, with about 7,000 in the uk.

scotland's first minister has told a group of high school pupils that it is okay to get drunk ""once in a while"".

jack mcconnell was speaking to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions. he has been criticised by the snp for encouraging young people to get drunk. but the scottish executive has insisted mr mcconnell was speaking about adults and his comments were ""a recognition that people will get drunk"". the first minister's comments came in a question and answer session at glenurquhart high school in inverness, attended by pupils from a number of secondary schools. a highland councillor who was at the event has also defended mr mcconnell. margaret davidson, the independent member for the loch ness west, said the first minister was speaking in a very general way and she was sure he was speaking about adults at the time.

when one pupil asked mr mcconnell how the executive proposed to tackle under-age drinking, began his response with the quip: ""i'm sure there's no under-age drinking in the highlands."" he went on to speak about the evils of binge drinking and railed against irresponsible drinks promotions. he said: ""i hope i'm not going to be seen as preaching to anybody here but the really serious problem at the moment is binge drinking and the impact it has on people's health and their ability to control what's happening round about them."" mr mcconnell said he regularly saw reports on the effects of binge drinking sprees which ended in assaults or even rapes, and on the health consequences of binge drinking. ""the one thing we are going to do something really serious about is binge drinking and irresponsible drinks promotions that can help lead to that,"" he said. ""far too many pub chains in particular are selling far too much booze far too cheaply and encouraging people to drink it far too quickly. ""we are go to clamp down on that and make those promotions illegal in the hope that people can enjoy a drink sensibly over the course of an evening.""

he added: ""by all means get drunk once in a while - but do not get into a situation where people are being encouraged to get completely incapable just to save some money and drink more quickly."" snp holyrood leader nicola sturgeon said: ""this is an incredible gaffe by jack mcconnell.

1143,"football manager scores big time

for the past decade or so the virtual football fans among us will have become used to the annual helping of championship manager (cm). indeed, it seems like there has been a cm game for as many years as there have been pcs.

however, last year was the final time that developers sports interactive (si) and publishers eidos would work together. they decided to go their separate ways, and each kept a piece of the franchise. si kept the game's code and database, and eidos retained rights to the cm brand, and the look and feel of the game. so at the beginning of this year, fans faced a new situation. eidos announced the next cm game, with a new team to develop it from scratch, whilst si developed the existing code further to be released, with new publishers sega, under the name football manager. so what does this mean? well, football manager is the spiritual successor to the cm series, and it has been released earlier than expected. at this point cm5 looks like it will ship early next year. but given that football manager 2005 is by and large the game that everybody knows and loves, how does this new version shape up?

a game like fm2005 could blind you with statistics. it has an obscene number of playable leagues, an obscene number of manageable teams and a really obscene number of players and staff from around the world in the database, with stats faithfully researched and compiled by a loyal army of fans. but that does not do justice to the game really. what we are talking about is the most realistic and satisfying football management game to ever grace the earth.

you begin by picking the nations and leagues you want to manage teams from, for instance england and scotland. that will give you a choice not just of the four main scottish leagues, but the english premiership all the way down to the conference north and south. of course you might be looking for european glory, or to get hold of abramovich's millions, in which case you can take control at chelsea, or even barcelona, real madrid, ac milan ... the list goes on a very long way. once in a team you will be told by the board what they expect of you. sometimes it is promotion, or a place in europe, sometimes it is consolidation or a brave relegation battle. it might even be a case of champions or else. obviously the expectations are linked to the team you choose, so choose wisely. then it is time to look at your squad, work out your tactics, seeing how much cash, if any, you have got to splash, having a look at the transfer market, sorting out the training schedule and making sure your backroom staff are up to it. then bring on the matches, which are once more available in the ever-improving top down 2d view. with the exception of the improved user interface on the surface, not much else seems to have changed.

however, there have been a lot of changes under the bonnet as well - things like the manager mind-games, which let you talk to the media about the opposition bosses. the match engine is also much improved, and it is more of a joy than ever to watch. in fact just about every area of the game has been tweaked, and it leads to an ever more immersive experience.

with a game that is so complex and so open-ended, there are of course a few glitches, but nowhere near the sorts of problems that have blighted previous releases. with so many calculations to perform the game can take some time to process in between matches, though there have been improvements in this area. and a sport like football, which is so high profile and unpredictable itself, can never be modelled quite to everybody's satisfaction. but this time around a great deal of hard work has been put in to ensure that any oddities that do crop up are cosmetic only, and do not affect gameplay. and if there are problems further down the line, sports interactive have indicated their usual willingness to support and develop the game as far as possible. in all there are many more tweaks and improvements. if you were a fan of the previous cm games, then fm2005 might make you forget there was anything else before it. if you are new to the genre but like the idea of trying to take margate into the premiership, spurs into europe, or even putting rangers back on the top of the tree, fm2005 could be the best purchase you ever made. just be warned that the family might not see you much at christmas.

1313,"domain system opens door to scams

a system to make it easier to create website addresses using alphabets like cyrillic could open a back door for scammers, a trade body has warned.

the internationalised domain names system has been a work in progress for years and has recently been approved by the internet engineering task force. but the uk internet forum (ukif) is concerned that the system will let scammers create fake sites more easily. the problem lies in the computer codes used to represent language.

registering names that look like that of legitimate companies but lead users to fake sites designed to steal passwords and credit card details could become a whole lot easier for determined scammers, says stephen dyer, director of ukif. domain names are the ""real language"" addresses of websites, rather than their internet protocol address, which is a series of numbers. they are used so people can more easily navigate the web. so-called ascii codes are used to represent european languages but for other languages a hybrid of a system called unicode is used. so, for example, website paypal could now be coded using a mixture of the latin alphabet and the russian alphabet. the resulting domain as displayed to the users would look identical to the real site as a russian 'a' look just like an english 'a'. but the computer code would be different, and the site it would lead users to could be a fake. this is more than just a theory. a fake paypal.com has already been registered with net domain giant verisign by someone who has followed the debate around the internationalised domain name (idn) system, said mr dyer. as the idea was to prove a point rather than be malicious the fake domain has now been handed back to paypal but it sets a worrying precedent, mr dyer said. ""although the idn problem is well known in technical circles, the commercial world is totally unaware how easily their websites can be faked,"" said mr dyer.

""it is important to alert users that there is a new and invisible and almost undetectable way of diverting them to what looks like a perfectly genuine site,"" he added. there are solutions. for instance, browsers could spot domains that use mixed characters and display them in different colours as a warning to users. mr dyer acknowledged that it would be a huge undertaking to update all the world's browsers. another solution, to introduce idn-disabled browsers could be a case of ""throwing out the baby with the bath water,"" he said. centr, the council of european national top level domain registries, agrees. ""a rush to introduce idn-disabled browsers into the marketplace is an overly-zealous step that will harm public confidence in idns - a technology that is desperately needed in the non-english speaking world,"" the organisation said in a statement.

302,"labour's four little words

labour has unveiled the four little words that will form the heart of its general election campaign which, for those just returned from the planet galifray, is ""looming"".

the slogan ""britain forward not back"" (no, it's not an instruction from one of those inter-planetary time lords) is to become as much a part of our daily lives as the sky - it's always there but we mostly stop noticing. the word ""britain"" is cast on a red background - a nod to old labour. ""forward"" is in italics and cunningly slopes forward and, along with ""not back"", is set against a mushy pea green background. as one of the journalists assembled at the unveiling declared, it was all very post modern, or something. great use of colour. those ad men really do earn their money. and, coincidentally, the ad men who came up with the abandoned flying pigs and so-called ""fagin"" posters which caused tory protests have not been sacked but, as election supremo alan milburn declared, ""are doing a very good job"".

mr milburn, in the latest in his series of pre-election-campaign campaigning, explained the slogan was the reaction to polling which suggests the public believe labour and tony blair are the future while michael howard and the tories would take the country backwards. ""not many people talk about the years before 1997 as the good old days,"" he declared. it would be an aggressive campaign because things would inevitably boil down to a choice between labour and the tories.

nobody, he claimed, could picture liberal democrat leader charles kennedy walking up downing street the day after polling. they could, however, picture michael howard or, of course, tony blair doing it. so it was only right that the campaign concentrated on rigorously examining the opposition's policies and past record. and tony blair would be in the very front line of that campaign, he said. ""between now and the election the prime minister will be spending more time out of london than in it but in britain, not overseas,"" he promised. ""he will be leading the domestic debate from the front, listening, taking the flak."" so, let's get on with it then.

396,"ministers lose slopping out case

the scottish executive has lost an appeal against an inmate's compensation for being forced to slop out in prison.

armed robber robert napier, 25, won â£2,450 after he claimed he suffered an outbreak of the skin complaint, eczema, when slopping out at barlinnie prison. napier said that the practice, where prisoners use buckets in their cells as toilets, breached his human rights. on thursday, the court of session threw out a move by the executive to apply a more rigorous standard of proof.

the executive faces more than 1,000 similar claims for damages from prisoners and former inmates. more than 310 actions have already been raised in the court of session and sheriff courts in scotland. an executive spokesman said: ""we will study this judgement in detail. much has changed to address the issues raised in the napier case, for example, slopping out has ended at barlinnie and work in other prisons is being accelerated. ""today's judgement does not affect the outcome of other cases."" napier, a remand prisoner at the time, raised a legal challenge in 2001 under the european convention on human rights, in which he sought â£5,000. he was awarded compensation last april after winning his case.

executive ministers raised an appeal arguing that the standard of proof to be applied in cases alleging a breach of the european convention on human rights through degrading and inhumane treatment should ""be beyond reasonable doubt"". this is the standard normally applied in criminal trials in scotland. however, civil litigation is settled on the test of ""a balance of probabilities"". judge lord cullen, sitting with lord osborne and lord hamilton, ruled that alleged human rights breaches involving degrading treatment should be dealt with on the normal civil standard. napier's lawyer tony kelly believes the action will soon be followed by others. mr kelly said: ""there are hundreds of people still undergoing slopping out, overcrowding and poor regime and those people will certainly be heartened by today's judgement."" scottish national party justice minister kenny macaskill said that the slopping out case had been ""a fiasco from start to finish"". he said: ""ministers were fully aware of the state of scotland's jails. funds were available but they chose to ignore the problem and after this ruling i suspect we will be faced with even more claims and no doubt more payouts. ""a short term executive saving has resulted in a long term public cost.""

""if the bandwidth is there then isps will buy it,"" said jill finger, a research director at analyst firm idc. others will be watching bt retail's trials, which is initially for employees and later in the summer for customers, with interest. for bt retail, she said, the super-fast service could be a way of differentiating it from other players.

1109,"apple mac mini gets warm welcome

the mac mini has been welcomed by apple fans, industry experts and pc users.

the release of the tiny, low-cost machine is seen as a good move for apple which currently has a small share of the desktop computer market. mac watchers and some analysts say the mac mini will go a long way to help apple appeal to the mass of consumers. they speculate that the mac mini will be bought by ipod owners and those wanting an easy-to-use and administer second home computer.

""it's the bravest move they have made yet,"" said jonny evans, news editor at macworld magazine. mr evans said the combination of low cost, small size and huge numbers of ipod users could make it a big success.

he thought that the machine would appeal to those that like apple technology but who before now have balked at paying high prices for its hardware. ""it's deeply affordable,"" he said. ""plus you know that you do not get viruses or all of the associated problems."" already, he said, pc owning friends had declared that they would be buying one. interest in the new products launched at macworld expo was so strong that websites for apple's store and the show struggled to cope with demand. according to response statistics gathered by netcraft many visiting the apple store in the wake of mr jobs' speech suffered lengthy response times. the macworld expo site was completely overwhelmed and went offline.

""i think fundamentally it's a good idea because it's cheap even for a pc,"" said nick ross, deputy labs editor at pc pro. apple's work on making things easy to use would also help the mac mini win fans, he said. ""i think people expect it just to work now and really it should,"" hesaid. the mac mini could find a role in homes that need a second computer that is easy to install and administer, he said. ""for browsing the web, e-mail and all kinds of basic duties it's going to be absolutely adequate,"" said mr ross. ian fogg, broadband and personal technology analyst at jupiter research, agreed that the mac mini could be very popular. ""apple has been hoping that sales of the ipod will have a halo effect on the sales of the mac,"" he said.

before now, he said, apple has been seen as a premium brand. but, he said, the mac mini changed that perception. ""it's a particularly good price when you see that it's apple that is doing it,"" he said. apple expects the mac mini to sell for â£339 in the uk and $499 in the us. adding extras such as a larger hard drive, more memory and networking options will increase the basic price. it will go on sale from 22 january. ""for consumers interested in style, design and small size - which is what the majority of ipod customers are interested in - it's a natural next step,"" said mr fogg. apple has traditionally done well in the market that the mac mini is aimed at, said mr fogg, who also expected many pc makers to release copycat devices in reaction.

his only misgivings were over how easy other consumers, other than ipod owners, would find using the machine. he said anyone wanting to use the mac mini with the peripherals from an old computer may find it odd to have something so small and sleek next to a hulking monitor. ""they'd be much more likely to pair a mac mini with a lcd or flat panel monitor which increases the upgrade cost,"" he said. those with flat screens and lcd monitors are likely to have bought them recently and not be in the market for a new machine.

there are also questions over whether the mac mini will work with very old peripherals, such as display, keyboard and mouse. the mac mini also fell short of being a media server that can be a video recorder as well as a store for all the digital music, movies and images people accumulate, said mr fogg. ""the mac mini is not quite ready for that yet,"" he said. ""it does not have the right connectors that fit a tv screen or enough storage."" said mr fogg: ""it's very much a computer."" one dissenting opinion came from brian gammage, vice-president of research at analysts gartner. he said: ""i don't think it changes the world."" although the mac mini was very cheap for an apple computer, it was still expensive compared to many pcs. also, he said, it appealed in categories that few consumers care about when buying a home computer. ""the pc world is a pile-em-high, sell-em-cheap market,"" he said, ""and all of them are pretty interchangeable."" ""since the days when apple ruled the personal computing world its market share has been on a long, slow decline,"" he said. ""every few years it does something to give its market share a kick then it starts to go back down again,"" said mr gammage. the release of the mac mini fit perfectly with this trend, he said.

1775,"call to overhaul uk state pension

the uk pension system has been branded inadequate and too complex by a leading retirement think-tank.

the pensions policy institute (ppi) said replacing the state pension with a ""citizen's pension"" would help tackle inequality and complexity. the change would see pensions being calculated on length of residency in the uk rather than national insurance (ni) contributions. reform could reduce poverty by aiding people with broken employment records.

the ppi added that once the state system was reformed the government should look at options to overhaul private and workplace pensions. the think tank's proposals were made in response to the recent publication of the pensions commission's initial report into uk retirement savings. according to the pensions commission's report 12 million working people are not saving enough for their retirement. as a result, living standards could fall for the next generation of uk pensioners. the report added that a combination of higher taxes, higher savings and/or a higher average retirement age was needed to solve the uk pension crisis.

2015,"qantas considers offshore option

australian airline qantas could transfer as many as 7,000 jobs out of its home country as it seeks to save costs, according to newspaper reports.

chief executive geoff dixon was quoted by the australian newspaper as saying the carrier could no longer afford to remain ""all-australian"". unions criticised the possible move - which may affect cabin and maintenance staff - saying qantas was profitable. more than 90% of the airline's staff are based in australia.

qantas confirmed it was looking at whether it might recruit and source products overseas - potentially through joint ventures - but said it would continue to create jobs in australia.

despite making a record australian dollars 648m ($492m) profit last year, qantas has argued that it needs to make considerable savings if it is to remain competitive. ""we're going to have to get the lowest cost structure we can and that willmean sourcing things more and more from overseas,"" the newspaper quoted qantas chief executive geoff dixon as saying. early this year, qantas increased the number of flight attendants based in london from 370 to 870. if qantas were to follow the lead of other airlines moving staff 'offshore' 7,000 jobs could shift overseas, the newspaper reported. in a statement, qantas said it was looking to build its operations overseas. however, it stressed this would not result in large scale redundancies in its home market, where most of its 35,000 staff are employed. ""we are totally committed to continuing to grow jobs in australia,"" mr dixon said. ""we are, however, operating in a global market and there is no room for complacency simply because we are currently profitable and successful.""

unions reacted angrily to the reported disclosure, arguing that qantas was profitable and did not need to take such action. ""we could understand if qantas was a struggling airline about to go under,"" michael mijatov, international division secretary of the flight attendants association, told agence france presse. ""qantas announced a record profit last year and is on course this year for an even greater profit so it is totally unnecessary."" in an effort to meet the challenge posed by low cost carriers, qantas sought a tie-up with air new zealand last year however, the deal was thrown out by the new zealand high court on competition grounds.

249,"faith schools citizenship warning

schools must improve the quality of citizenship lessons - or social cohesion and democracy will suffer, says the education watchdog.

independent faith schools were singled out by ofsted chief, david bell, for not doing enough to promote the ""wider tenets of british society"". mr bell said muslim, jewish and evangelical christian schools must be ""intolerant of intolerance"". diversity ""certainly must not mean segregated or separate"", he said. mr bell's speech called for a much greater effort in all types of schools to teach citizenship - with an accompanying survey showing that young people knew little about politics and had no enthusiasm to find out more.

badly-taught citizenship lessons have previously been criticised by mr bell, and in a speech to the hansard society, he warned that it was failing to pass on an understanding of democracy, public service and shared values. he highlighted his particular concern for citizenship in the growing number of independent faith schools - which he said included about 100 muslim, 100 evangelical christian and 50 jewish schools.

mr bell expressed concern about schools which did not teach children enough about a ""common heritage"" and needed to do more to promote principles of mutual tolerance and social inclusion. ""i worry that many young people are being educated in faith-based schools, with little appreciation of their wider responsibilities and obligations to british society,"" said mr bell. the ofsted chief said his forthcoming annual report would make particular reference to muslim schools. ""many must adapt their curriculum to ensure that it provides pupils with a broad general knowledge of public institutions and services in england and helps them to acquire an appreciation of and respect for other cultures in a way that promotes tolerance and harmony."" mr bell said such questions of religion and cultural identity were ""tricky issues"". but he argued that ""we must not allow our recognition of diversity to become apathy in the face of any challenge to our coherence as a nation"". ""i would go further and say that an awareness of our common heritage as british citizens, equal under the law, should enable us to assert with confidence that we are intolerant of intolerance, illiberalism and attitudes and values that demean the place of certain sections of our community, be they women or people living in non-traditional relationships,"" said mr bell.

1892,"crude oil prices back above $50

cold weather across parts of the united states and much of europe has pushed us crude oil prices above $50 a barrel for the first time in almost three months.

freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall have increased demand for heating fuel in the us, where stocks are low. fresh falls in the value of the dollar helped carry prices above the $50 mark for the first time since november. a barrel of us crude oil closed up $2.80 to $51.15 in new york on tuesday. opec members said on tuesday that it saw no reason to cut its output.

although below last year's peak of $55.67 a barrel, which was reached in october, prices are now well above 2004's average of $41.48.

brent crude also rose in london trading, adding $1.89 to $48.62 at the close. much of western europe and the north east of america has been shivering under unseasonably low temperatures in recent days. the decline in the us dollar to a five-week low against the euro has also served to inflate prices. ""the dollar moved sharply overnight and oil is following it,"" said chris furness, senior market strategist at 4cast. ""if the dollar continues to weaken, oil will be obviously higher.""

several opec members said a cut in production was unlikely, citing rising prices and strong demand for oil from asia. ""i agree that we do not need to cut supply if the prices are as much as this,"" fathi bin shatwan, libya's oil minister, told reuters. ""i do not think we need to cut unless the prices are falling below $35 a barrel,"" he added. opec closely watches global stocks to ensure that there is not an excessive supply in the market. the arrival of spring in the northern hemisphere will focus attention on stockpiles of us crude and gasoline, which are up to 9% higher than at this time last year. heavy stockpiles could help force prices lower when demand eases.

23,"tories urge 'change at the top'

tory delegates are gathering for what is expected to be their last conference before the general election, declaring britain needs ""a change at the top"".

the party goes into its spring forum trying to highlight what it sees as a clear choice between it and labour. tory co-chairman liam fox has opened proceedings with a speech criticising tony blair's record in government. labour's rule has been characterised by ""lost trust and failure to deliver"", he told the brighton conference. he also attacked the government's ""failure"" to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the nhs, telling delegates labour cannot be trusted on education or crime. a tory government would sort out the ""shambles"" of immigration, put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools, he said. dr fox also underlined tory promises to cut tax by â£4bn.

bbc political correspondent shaun ley says opinion polls suggest the tories still lag some way behind labour on the issues of health, education and the economy. conservative leader michael howard, who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on friday, will address them in a lunchtime speech. his welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in london to lead the party's opposition to the prevention of terrorism bill in its lengthy progress through parliament. the bill was finally passed on friday evening, after more than 30 hours of debate. mr howard is likely to defend his party's handling of the bill, which was only passed after the conservatives accepted prime minister tony blair's promise that mps would be able to review it within a year.

1184,"pandas benefit from wireless net

the world's dwindling panda population is getting a helping hand from a wireless internet network.

the wolong nature reserve in the sichuan province of southwest china is home to 20% of the remaining 1,500 giant pandas in the world. a broadband and wireless network installed on the reserve has allowed staff to chronicle the pandas' daily activities. the data and images can be shared with colleagues around the world. the reserve conducts vital research on both panda breeding and bamboo ecology.

using the network, vets have been able to observe how infant pandas feed and suggest changes to improve the tiny cubs' chances of survival.

""digital technology has transformed the way we communicate and share information inside wolong and with the rest of the world,"" said zhang hemin, director of the wolong nature reserve. ""our researchers now have state-of-the-art digital technology to help foster the panda population and manage our precious surroundings."" the network has been developed by intel, working closely with the staff at wolong. it includes a 802.11b wireless network and a video monitoring system using five cameras to observe pandas around the clock.

before the new infrastructure arrived at the panda park, staff walked or drove to deliver floppy disks across the reserve. infant panda health was recorded on paper notebooks and research teams in the field had little access to the data. to foster cultural links across the globe, a children's learning lab has been incorporated in the network, in collaboration with globio (federation for global biodiversity education for children), an international non-profit organisation. it will enable children at local primary schools to hook up with their peers in portland, oregon in the us. ""digital technology brings this story to life by enabling a global dialogue to help bridge cultures around the world,"" said globio founder gerry ellis.

security firms are warning about a windows virus disguising itself as an electronic christmas card.

the zafi.d virus translates the christmas greeting on its subject line into the language of the person receiving infected e-mail. anti-virus firms speculate that this multilingual ability is helping the malicious program spread widely online. anti-virus firm sophos said that 10% of the e-mail currently on the net was infected with the zafi virus.

like many other windows viruses, zafi-d plunders microsoft outlook for e-mail addresses and then uses mail-sending software to despatch itself across the web to new victims. to be infected users must open up the attachment travelling with the message which bears the code for the malicious bug. the attachment on the e-mail poses as an electronic christmas card but anyone opening it will simply get a crude image of two smiley faces.

the virus' subject line says ""merry christmas"" and translates this into one of 15 languages depending of the final suffix of the e-mail address the infected message has been sent to. the message in the body of the e-mail reads: ""happy holidays"" and this too is translated. on infected machines the virus tries to disable anti-virus and firewall software and opens up a backdoor on the pc to hand over control to the writer of the virus. the virus is thought to have spread most widely in south america, italy, spain, bulgaria and hungary. the original zafi virus appeared in april this year.

259,"ministers 'naive' over phone-taps

the government is being naive by refusing to allow phone-tap evidence in court, a senior eu politician says.

javier solana, eu foreign policy chief, says phone-tap evidence works in the courts of other european countries. human rights groups, top police officers and many mps say allowing the evidence would remove the need to detain terror suspects without charge. but home secretary charles clarke says the evidence would not make much difference to these cases. mr solana told itv1's jonathan dimbleby programme: ""[phone-tap evidence in court] works, it is normal that it is done, it would be naive not to do it. ""it would be naive not to use this technological thing that we have at our disposal."" mr solana's comments come the day after sir ian blair, the newly-appointed metropolitan police commissioner, said he was in favour of phone-tap evidence.

under the anti-terrorism crimes and security act 2001, foreign terror suspects can be detained in british jails without trial or charge. several suspects have been detained under these powers because evidence against them was deemed too sensitive to be heard in court.

some of this evidence is believed to be telephone intercepts. human rights group liberty has argued that if intercept evidence could be heard, these detainees could be brought to trial. but critics of phone-tap trials say the evidence is often weak and can expose the methods of the security services. the home secretary says intercepts would not make much difference because cases against terror suspects frequently rely on other kinds of surveillance. but mr clarke has been forced to change the regime of detention without trial after law lords ruled it illegal. he has opted for a system of ""control orders"" whereby suspects, both british and foreign, can be held under house arrest or surveillance. these orders will again involve a uk opt-out of parts of the european convention on human rights. while accepting that people ""have to be prepared"" for a possible terrorist attack, mr solana said he had ""qualms"" about the home secretary's new plans. ""we have to fight terrorism with all our means, but not so far as to change our way of life,"" he said.

the world's first digital cinema network will be established in the uk over the next 18 months.

the uk film council has awarded a contract worth â£11.5m to arts alliance digital cinema (aadc), who will set up the network of up to 250 screens. aadc will oversee the selection of cinemas across the uk which will use the digital equipment. high definition projectors and computer servers will be installed to show mainly british and specialist films. most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to 250 screens in up to 150 cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images. the new network will double the world's total of digital screens. cinemas will be given the film on a portable hard drive and they will then copy the content to a computer server.

each film is about 100 gigabytes and has been compressed from an original one terabyte-size file. fiona deans, associate director of aadc, said the compression was visually lossless so no picture degradation will occur.

the film will all be encrypted to prevent piracy and each cinema will have an individual key which will unlock the movie. ""people will see the picture quality is a bit clearer with no scratches. ""the picture will look exactly the same as when the print was first made - there is no degradation in quality over time.""

the key benefit of the digital network will be an increase in the distribution and screening of british films, documentaries and foreign language films.

""access to specialised film is currently restricted across the uk,"" said pete buckingham, head of distribution and exhibition at the uk film council. ""although a genuine variety of films is available in central london and a few other metropolitan areas, the choice for many outside these areas remains limited, and the digital screen network will improve access for audiences across the uk,"" digital prints costs less than a traditional 35mm print - giving distributors more flexibility in how they screen films, said ms deans. ""it can cost up to â£1,500 to make a copy of a print for specialist films. ""in the digital world you can make prints for considerably less than that. ""distributors can then send out prints to more cinemas and prints can stay in cinemas for much longer."" the uk digital network will be the first to employ 2k projectors - which are capable of showing films at resolutions of 2048 * 1080 pixels. a separate competitive process to determine which cinemas will receive the digital screening technology will conclude in may. the sheer cost of traditional prints means that some cinemas need to show them twice a day in order to recoup costs. ""some films need word of mouth and time to build momentum - they don't need to be shown twice a day,"" explained ms deans. ""a cinema will often book a 35mm print in for two weeks - even if the film is a roaring success they cannot hold on to the print because it will have to go to another cinema. ""with digital prints, every cinema will have its own copy.""

2170,"russia gets investment blessing

soaring oil sales and a budget surplus mean russian debt is no longer a risky investment, one of the world's leading credit rating agencies says.

standard & poor's has classed russian bonds as ""investment grade"", up from their former ""speculative"" rating. russia's reputation among investors has been hurt in recent months by the heavy tax bills and asset seizures imposed on companies such as oil giant yukos. s&p said the solidity of government finances outweighed the risk. russia is now a net creditor rather than a debtor. gold and foreign currency reserves of $119bn beat its foreign public debt of some $113bn.

the other two major ratings agencies - fitch and moody's have long since upped their rating of russia's sovereign debt. s&p had held back through fear that the government was dragging its feet on economic and legal reforms. now, though, it has finally followed suit. but the agency made it clear that the improved rating did not mean that the risks were a thing of the past. instead, with russian government coffers brimming with tax revenues from energy sales, s&p said the government's own debt is looking a good bet. ""these improvements are so significant that they now outweight the serious and growing political risk that continues to be a key ratings constraint on russia,"" wrote s&p credit analyst helena hessel.

the yukos saga is the most high-profile of the political risks to which ms hessel alludes. the company's founder and ex-chief executive, mikhail khodorkovsky, is in jail on trial for tax evasion and fraud. many believe the real motive for his prosecution is that he threatened to use his wealth to set up a political alternative to president vladimir putin. his company, meanwhile, is widely believed to have fallen victim to the kremlin's wish to get russian energy resources as far as possible back under state control.

2116,"high fuel costs hit us airlines

two of the largest airlines in the us - american and southwest - have blamed record fuel prices for their disappointing quarterly results.

american airlines' parent amr reported a loss of $387m (â£206m) for the fourth quarter of 2004, against a $111m loss for the same period a year earlier. meanwhile, southwest airlines saw its fourth-quarter 2004 profits fall 15% to $56m, against $66m a year earlier. both said high fuel bills would continue to pressure revenues in 2005. american, the world's biggest airline by some measures, said it expected to report a loss for the first quarter of 2005. southwest, which has the highest market value of any us carrier, said it would remain profitable despite high fuel prices.

amr's shares were flat in wednesday morning trading on the new york stock exchange, as the results were slightly better than analysts had anticipated. amr's chief executive gerard arpey said the airline's difficulties reflected the situation within the industry. ""amr's results for the fourth quarter of 2004 reflect the economic woes that plagued the airline industry throughout 2004 - in particular, high fuel prices and a tough revenue environment,"" he said. for the full year, amr posted a loss of $761m, lower than 2003's $1.2bn loss and an indication that the airline has successfully cut costs. amr added that as part of its cost cutting measures, it is postponing the delivery of 54 boeing jets. shares in southwest fell 65 cents to $14.35 as analysts voiced their disappointment. ""the results came in below our already conservative estimate for the quarter,"" said ray neidl, an analyst at calyon securities. both american and southwest have been squeezed by cut-throat competition in the us airline industry, as a glut of available seats has led to fierce price reductions.

oil prices retreated from four-month highs in early trading on tuesday after producers' cartel opec said it was now unlikely to cut production.

following the comments by acting opec secretary general adnan shihab-eldin, us light crude fell 32 cents to $51.43 a barrel. he said that high oil prices meant opec was unlikely to stick to its plan to cut output in the second quarter. in london, brent crude fell 32 cents to $49.74 a barrel.

opec members are next meeting to discuss production levels on 16 march. on monday, oil prices rose for a sixth straight session, reaching a four-month high as cold weather in the us threatened stocks of heating oil. us demand for heating oil was predicted to be about 14% above normal this week, while stocks were currently about 7.5% below the levels of a year ago. cold weather across europe has also put upward pressure on crude prices.

sri lanka faces a $1.3bn (â£691m) bill in 2005 for reconstruction after the tsunami which killed more than 30,000 of its people, its central bank says.

this estimate is preliminary, bank governor sunil mendis told reporters, and could rise in 2006. the island state is asking for about $320m from the international monetary fund to help pay for relief, he said. the bank has 5bn rupees ($50m; â£27m) set aside to lend at a lower interest rate to those who lost property. according to mr mendis, half the imf support could come from a freeze on debt repayments, which would free up resources immediately. the rest could come from a five-year emergency loan. sri lanka is hoping for a wider freeze from other creditors.

the paris club of 19 creditors meets on 12 january to discuss a debt moratorium for the nations hit by the tsunami, which ravaged south and east asia on 26 december.

some 150,000 people across the region are feared to be dead and millions have been left homeless and destitute. a full reckoning of the economic cost to sri lanka of the tsunami will not be clear for some time to come. but already it looks likely that growth in the first half of 2005 will slow, mr mendis told reporters, although he would not say by how much. one side-effect of the disaster has been that the value of the rupee has risen as foreign funds have flooded into the country. the currency has strengthened 4% since late december, coming close to 100 rupees to the us dollar for the first time in more than six months.

1827,"us to rule on yukos refuge call

yukos has said a us bankruptcy court will decide whether to block russia's impending auction of its main production arm on thursday.

the russian oil firm has filed for bankruptcy protection in the us in an attempt to halt the forced sale. however, judge letitia clark said the hearing would continue on thursday when arguments in the case would be heard. russian authorities are due to auction off yuganskneftegas on 19 december to pay a huge tax bill sent to yukos.

russian prosecutors are forcing the sale of the firm's most lucrative asset yuganskneftegas to help pay a $27bn (â£14bn) back tax bill, which they claim is owed by yukos.

filing for bankruptcy protection in the us was ""a last resort to preserve the rights of our shareholders, employees and customers,"" said yukos chief executive steven theede. the company added it had opted to take action through american courts as us bankruptcy law gives worldwide jurisdiction over a debtor company's property and because it was seeking a judiciary willing to protect the value of shareholders' investments. however, as the firm is based in russia and has no significant us assets, lawyers are unsure of the outcome of the case. ""we are here to stop 60% of our body from being cut off on sunday,"" zack clement, a lawyer for yukos, told judge clark in an emergency hearing in houston, texas, on wednesday. as well as the bid to get chapter 11 bankruptcy - which protects firms from creditors, allowing them to continue trading as they restructure their finances - the group also made a claim for damages against the russian government. yukos asked the houston court to order russia to arbitration so that it can press claims for billions of dollars in damages over a ""campaign of illegal, discriminatory and disproportionate"" tax claims. mr clement said that under russian law, the russian government was obliged to enter into arbitration as set out in international law.

he added that the opening bid for the firm's yuganskneftgas unit was $8bn - less than half of the $20bn that yukos advisers say it is worth. ""we believe the only significant bidder at the auction on sunday is gazprom,"" he said, referring to russia's natural gas giant. yukos maintains that the forced auction is illegal and ""will cause the company to suffer immediate and irreparable harm."" many commentators believe the russian government's aggressive pursuit of yukos is a politically-motivated response to the political ambitions of its former chief executive, mikhail khodorkovsky. mr khodorkovsky, who had funded liberal opposition groups, was arrested in october last year on fraud and tax evasion charges and is still in jail analysts believe that if its production unit is auctioned off, it is likely to be bought up by a government-backed firm, like gazprom, effectively bringing a large chunk of russia's lucrative oil and gas industry back under state control.

""the iaaf will decide if we can compete again in greece and abroad,"" thanou told to vima newspaper in her first interview since the athens olympics. ""if given the green light i will run again - that's the only thing i want."" thanou, 30, and her compatriot kostas kenteris were provisionally suspended by the iaaf in december for missing three drugs tests. the third was alleged to have been on the eve of the opening ceremony of the athens olympics.

but an independent tribunal of the greek athletics federation overturned the provisional ban on 18 march. the iaaf - which said it was ""very surprised"" by the decision of the greek tribunal - is deciding whether to appeal against the decision at the court of arbitration for sport. however, dick pound, the chairman of the world anti-doping authority, has said he will appeal against the decision if the iaaf does not. and thanou and kenteris face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident. thanou said: ""i can see how people can think the accident seemed like a childish excuse.

us federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has given a speech at a scottish church in honour of the pioneering economist, adam smith.

he delivered the 14th adam smith lecture in kirkcaldy, fife. the adam smith lecture celebrates the author of 1776's wealth of nations, which became a bible of capitalism. dr greenspan was invited by chancellor gordon brown, whose minister father john used to preach at the st bryce kirk church. mr brown introduced dr greenspan to the 400 invited guests as the ""the world's greatest economist"". dr greenspan, 79, who has been in the uk to attend the g7 meeting in london, said the world could never repay the debt of gratitude it owed to smith, whose genius he compared to that of mozart.

he said the philosopher was a ""towering contributor to the modern world"". ""kirkcaldy, the birthplace in 1723 of adam smith and, by extension, of modern economics, is also of course, where your chancellor was reared. ""i am led to ponder to what extent the chancellor's renowned economic and financial skills are the result of exposure to the subliminal intellect-enhancing emanation in this area."" he continued: ""smith reached far beyond the insights of his predecessors to frame a global view of how market economics, just then emerging, worked. ""in so doing he supported changes in societal organisation that were to measurably enhance standards of living.""

dr greenspan said smith's revolutionary philosophy on human self-interest, laissez-faire economics and competition had been a force for good in the world. ""the incredible insights of a handful of intellectuals of the enlightenment - especially with smith toiling in the environs of kirkcaldy - created the modern vision of people free to choose and to act according to their individual self-interest,"" he said. following his lecture, dr greenspan - who received an honorary knighthood from the queen at balmoral in 2002 - was awarded an honorary fellowship of the royal society of edinburgh. he later opened an exhibition dedicated to smith in the atrium of fife college of further and higher education. joyce johnston, principal of the college, said: ""it is very fitting that the world's premier economist delivered this lecture in tribute to the world's first economist."" dr greenspan - who became chairman of the federal reserve for an unprecedented fifth term in june 2004 - will step down in january next year. he has served under presidents george w bush, bill clinton, george bush, and ronald reagan. he was also chairman of the council of economic advisors to gerald ford.

elderly and disabled people would choose how their own budget for personal care was spent and organised under government plans.

ministers say elderly and disabled people themselves, not social workers, should be able to decide on their care and stay in their own homes. they also plan a supremo for adult services in each english area to get different agencies working together. but the government shunned opponents' calls for free long-term care.

there are 1.7m people needing care in england and ministers suggest the number could quadruple by 2050. monday's consultation paper on social care for adults in england is aimed at ending a system which generates dependency. health minister stephen ladyman said: ""this document is the antithesis of the nanny state.

""it's about taking power away from the state and giving it to individuals and saying that we will help you make these decisions but we are not going to make them for you any more."" the government has already allowed local councils to give people money so they can pay for their services directly but take-up of the scheme has been ""disappointing"".

ministers say the new plans would make direct payments simpler and try to counter reluctance in some local councils to use the payments. they also want to set up a new ""half-way house"" where social workers tell people how much money is available for their care and help them choose how to spend that ""individual budget"". the scheme will be funded on existing budgets set until 2008. but mr ladyman said the plans could deliver savings in some areas, such as freeing up nhs beds and preventing illnesses. he ruled out free personal care in england - which is on offer in scotland and wales, saying it was ""unsustainable"".

david rogers, from the local government association, said agencies were working together on the kind of innovation proposed by the government. and tony hunter, president of the association of directors of social services, said the plans could improve dignity and well-being for thousands of people. but age concern argued social care was chronically under-funded and older people were being offered choice in principle, but not in practice. its director general, gordon lishman, said: ""direct payments will not work if there are no services for people to choose from locally.""

the tories say people who pay for three years' long-term care directly or through insurance should be guaranteed free care for the rest of their lives. tory spokesman simon burns said more than 80,000 long term care places had been lost since 1997.

net profit surged 70% to 2.39bn rupees ($54.98m; â£29.32m) in the last three months of 2004 compared with 1.41bn rupees a year earlier. total sales were 30.1bn rupees, up 27% from the same 2004 period. maruti accounts for half of india's domestic car sales, luring consumers with cheap, fuel-efficient vehicles.

demand in india also has been driven by the poor state of public transport and the very low level of car ownership, analysts said.

figures show that only eight people per thousand are car owners. maruti beat market expectations despite an increase in raw materials costs. the company, majority-owned by japan's suzuki, said an increase in steel and other raw material prices was partially offset by cost cutting. sales in the fiscal third quarter, including vans and utility vehicles, rose by 17.8% to 136.069 units. maruti is not the only company benefiting as indian's economic growth gives consumer greater spending power. utility vehicle and tractor maker mahindra has reported a 52% rise in net profit during the last three months of 2004. profit was 1.33bn rupees compared with 874.2m rupees a year earlier.

138,"chancellor rallies labour voters

gordon brown has issued a rallying cry to supporters, warning the ""stakes are too high"" to stay at home or protest vote in the next general election.

the chancellor said the poll - expected to fall on 5 may - would give a ""clear and fundamental"" choice between labour investment and tory cuts. he told his party's spring conference the tories must not be allowed to win. the conservatives and lib dems insisted that voters faced higher taxes and means-testing under labour.

to a packed audience at gateshead's sage centre, mr brown accused shadow chancellor oliver letwin of plotting cuts that were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, gp and nurse in the country. laying into the conservative's record in government he said: ""i give you this promise - with labour, britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, â£3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. ""never again tory boom and bust.

""this will be the central dividing line at the election, between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of â£35bn in our services, and a labour government taking britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, i am proud to say, spend by 2008 â£60bn more."" turning to the economy, the chancellor promised to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.

he also pledged to continue the fight against child and pensioner poverty. and he promised help to get young people on the property ladder. ""my message to the thousands of young couples waiting to obtain their first home is that housing is rightly now at the centre of our coming manifesto,"" he said. ""and the next labour government will match our low mortgage rates with a new first-time buyers' initiative."" in the speech, which prompted a standing ovation, he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years.

he also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world's poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds, the creation of a network of children's centres and flexibility in maternity leave. responding to the speech, shadow chief secretary to the treasury, george osborne, said: ""this was more talk from gordon brown. ""we've heard it all before. instead of talking about the future he kept on talking about the past. ""he completely failed to say which taxes he would put up to fill the black hole in his spending plans. ""there will be a simple choice at the election - value for money and lower taxes with the conservatives, or more waste and higher taxes under tony blair and gordon brown.""

liberal democrat shadow chancellor vince cable warned the picture was not as rosy as mr brown would like to portray it. ""for all his trumpeting of labour's management of the economy, gordon brown's record is very mixed,"" he said.

2078,"feta cheese battle reaches court

a row over whether only greece should be allowed to label its cheese feta has reached the european court of justice.

the danish and german governments are challenging a european commission ruling which said greece should have sole rights to use the name. the commission's decision gave the same legal protection to feta as to italian parma ham and french champagne. but critics of the judgement say feta is a generic term, with the cheese produced widely outside greece.

the commission's controversial 2002 ruling gave ""protected designation of origin"" status to feta cheese made in greece, effectively restricting the use of the feta name to producers there.

from 2007 onwards, greek firms will have the exclusive use of the feta label and producers elsewhere in europe must find another name to describe their products. the german and danish governments argue that feta does not relate to a specific geographical area and that their firms have been producing and exporting the cheese for years. ""in our opinion it is a generic designation and we do not have any other name or term for this type of cheese,"" hans arne kristiansen, a spokesman for the danish dairy board, told the bbc. denmark is europe's second largest producer of feta after greece - producing about 30,000 tonnes a year - and exports its products to greece. it is concerned that the ruling could threaten the production of other cheeses in denmark such as brie. ""it would cost millions if we wanted to introduce a new designation,"" mr kristiansen said. ""that is just one of the costs.""

the case will also have a major impact on britain's sole feta producer, yorkshire company shepherds purse cheeses.

judy bell, the company's founder, said it would cost a huge amount to rebrand its product. ""if we lose we will have to go through a massive re-merchandising process and reorganisation,"" she said. ""we have never tried to pull the wool over anyone's eyes - it's very clear from the label that it's yorkshire feta."" the original decision was a victory for greece, where feta cheese is believed to have been produced for about 6,000 years. feta is a soft white cheese made from sheep or goat's milk, and is an essential ingredient in greek cuisine. greece makes 115,000 tonnes, mainly for domestic consumption. the court is expected to reach a verdict in the case in the autumn.

1992,"jobs growth still slow in the us

the us created fewer jobs than expected in january, but a fall in jobseekers pushed the unemployment rate to its lowest level in three years.

according to labor department figures, us firms added only 146,000 jobs in january. the gain in non-farm payrolls was below market expectations of 190,000 new jobs. nevertheless it was enough to push down the unemployment rate to 5.2%, its lowest level since september 2001. the job gains mean that president bush can celebrate - albeit by a very fine margin - a net growth in jobs in the us economy in his first term in office. he presided over a net fall in jobs up to last november's presidential election - the first president to do so since herbert hoover. as a result, job creation became a key issue in last year's election. however, when adding december and january's figures, the administration's first term jobs record ended in positive territory.

the labor department also said it had revised down the jobs gains in december 2004, from 157,000 to 133,000.

analysts said the growth in new jobs was not as strong as could be expected given the favourable economic conditions. ""it suggests that employment is continuing to expand at a moderate pace,"" said rick egelton, deputy chief economist at bmo financial group. ""we are not getting the boost to employment that we would have got given the low value of the dollar and the still relatively low interest rate environment."" ""the economy is producing a moderate but not a satisfying amount of job growth,"" said ken mayland, president of clearview economics. ""that means there are a limited number of new opportunities for workers.""

285,"economy focus for election battle

britain's economic future will be at the heart of labour's poll campaign, chancellor gordon brown has said.

he was speaking after cabinet members held their last meeting at no 10 before the expected election announcement. he said voters would recognise that labour had brought stability and growth, and would continue to do so. meanwhile the tories outlined their plans to tackle ""yob culture"" and the lib dems gave more details about their proposals to replace council tax. earlier the archbishop of canterbury wrote to all three parties urging them not to fight the election by exploiting people's fears.

in an open letter, he called on them not to turn the election into a competition about who can most effectively frighten voters about terrorism, asylum, and crime. he said they should concentrate instead on issues such as the environment, international development and the arms trade, family policy, and the reform of the criminal justice system.

shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said: ""we have fought a very positive campaign. i think he will want to look quite carefully at what jack straw said about michael howard.""

in a speech to the foreign policy centre mr straw said of the tory leader: ""he is clever, fluent and tactical, but he is not wise. ""he lacks strategy and good judgment, and his quick temper and impetuosity too often get the better of him."" the foreign secretary told the bbc: ""i was making the observation that because of michael howard's impetuosity you can get lurches of policy."" liberal democrat chairman matthew taylor said: ""people are already really turned off by the kind of campaign the others are fighting and you will see us putting emphasis on some of these huge issues facing the world, particularly the environment.""

labour's focus on the economy as their key message - came on the day a new report was published by the institute of fiscal studies, suggesting that household incomes have fallen for the first time in more than a decade. the ifs says the drop partly reflects measures announced in what it called the chancellor's tax-raising budget of 2002. the treasury dismissed the research as ""complete rubbish"". party election supremo alan milburn said the apparent drop in average incomes was because self-employed people had been affected by a ""world downturn"" which hit their profits. since 1997, the reported average take-home income had ""risen by 20% in real terms"" if you took out the self-employed, mr milburn told bbc radio 4's today programme. mr brown also dismissed the figures insisting that the ""typical family"" has been much better off under labour.

1170,"slim playstation triples sales

sony playstation 2's slimmer shape has proved popular with uk gamers, with 50,000 sold in its first week on sale.

sales have tripled since launch, outstripping microsoft's xbox, said market analysts chart-track. the numbers were also boosted by the release of the ps2-only game grand theft auto: san andreas. the title broke the uk sales record for video games in its first weekend of release. latest figures suggest it has sold more than 677,000 copies.

""it is obviously very, very encouraging for sony because microsoft briefly outsold them last week,"" john houlihan, editor of computerandvideogames.com told bbc news. ""and with halo 2 [for xbox] out next week, it really is a head-to-head contest between them and xbox.""

although xbox sales over the last week also climbed, ps2 sales were more than double that. the figures mean sony is reaching the seven million barrier for uk sales of the console. edinburgh-based developer, rockstar, which is behind the gta titles, has seen san andreas pull in an estimated â£24m in gross revenues over the weekend. in comparison, blockbuster films like harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban took â£11.5m in its first three days at the uk box office. the lord of the rings: the return of the king took nearly â£10m over its opening weekend, although games titles are four to five times more expensive than cinema tickets.

gangster-themed gta san andreas is the sequel to grand theft auto vice city which previously held the record for the fastest-selling video game ever. the xbox game halo 2, released on 11 november in the uk, is also widely tipped to be one of the best-selling games of the year. the original title won universal acclaim in 2001, and sold more than four million copies.

mr houlihan added that sony had done well with the ps2, but it definitely helped that the release of san andreas coincided with the slimline ps2 hitting the shelves. the run-up to christmas is a huge battlefield for games consoles and titles. microsoft's xbox had been winning the race up until last week in sales. the sales figures also suggest that it may be a largely adult audience driving demand, since gta san andreas has an 18 certificate. sony and microsoft have both reduced console prices recently and are preparing the way for the launches of their next generation consoles in 2005. ""both have hit crucial price points at around â£100 and that really does open up new consoles to new audience, plus the release of two really important games in terms of development are also driving those sales,"" said mr houlihan.

393,"mps tout lords replacement plan

a group of mps has tried to raise the pressure on tony blair over reform to the house of lords by publishing a detailed blueprint for change.

the cross-party group has unveiled a draft bill proposing a smaller second chamber in which 70% of members would be elected. mps and peers have failed to agree on reform since 1999 when 600 hereditaries lost their seats. the group says it can win support for removing the last 92 hereditaries. the government postponed plans to remove the remaining hereditary peers because they said they were unlikely to succeed after opposition in the lords. tony blair has argued. there needs to be consensus on reforms. there have been suggestions there will be proposals for changing at least the powers of the lords in labour's manifesto.

but the all-party group, including tories ken clarke and sir george young, labour's robin cook and tony wright and liberal democrat paul tyler, is confident its plan would win support from a ""large majority"". and they list former conservative leader william hague and former labour leader neil kinnock as supporters of the plans. the group says the british public and a clear majority of mps support replacing the lords with a largely-elected second chamber. their plan would see the house of lords being renamed the second chamber of parliament, and its members would be known as mscps.

there would be 385 mscps, including 270 elected members, 87 appointed members and 16 bishops. they would serve for between 12 and 14 years. mr cook said holding elections for mscps on the same day as those for mps might help motivate the electorate and increase voter turnout. he added: ""over the last year i have seen many statements from senior figures of this government insisting the public must have the right of choice. ""what could be more important than a choice of the people who sit in our parliament?""

the group believes pressure is growing for change and the government's current position is unsustainable. it wants all three main parties to include a commitment to a ""largely democratic"" second chamber in their manifestos. mr clarke said the issue ""went to the heart of reforming the health of the british political system"". and mr tyler said the prime minister's view that there was no agreement on the shape of the future of the lords was flawed. ""the problem, i think, in the prime minister's mind is there doesn't appear to be a consensus that includes him,"" he said. ""we are providing a consensus"". the elect the lords campaign said the draft bill was an important contribution to the debate. ""we believe this draft bill is detailed enough to form the basis of closer parliamentary scrutiny,"" said co-ordinator peter facey. ""in lieu of any other such clear proposals, the government must permit that to happen.""

1390,"briton wins short film oscar

three of the five nominees in the live-action short film category at this year's oscars were british. for andrea arnold, who won the category, ashvin kumar and gary mckendry the past month has thrust them from relative obscurity into the limelight.

arnold's gritty drama wasp is about a single mother living on the breadline, while kumar's little terrorist follows a young pakistani muslim boy, who gets stuck on the wrong side of the heavily armed indian border. mckendry's entry, everything in this country must, forces british soldiers and catholics to challenge their relationship during the troubles in northern ireland. last week, the trio attended an official screening of all the nominated short films at the academy's headquarters in beverly hills. ""i felt so privileged to have a thousand people watching my film on the biggest screen i've ever seen,"" says arnold.

set in her native dartford, wasp tells the story of a young mum, who, unable to find a babysitter, leaves her four young daughters outside a pub while she's on a date. the image that sparked the film was that of a wasp crawling into a baby's mouth. ""the other nominees said they made their films for this reason or that - they had something to say. but i just start with an image i can't shake off, work outwards from that and see what comes out,"" she explains.

since she presented children's tv shows number 73 and motormouth in the 1980s, arnold has kept a low profile and is having trouble adapting to this sudden onslaught of attention. ""i'm not interested in the publicity. it's not my personality. i'm overwhelmed by all the fuss,"" she said.

""it's all a bit like a beauty contest - all the films are great and so different. ""but even though my film has won 30 awards worldwide (including one at sundance last month), i'd still be proud of it - even if it hadn't won any."" asked what the nomination means to her, arnold says she feels ""flattered and honoured"". ""we've all been overwhelmed by the response and can't get it in perspective yet. i'm still reeling.""

and she won't commit to an opinion of hollywood yet. ""i'm just in the middle of it, living moment to moment, day to day."" but despite her reservations about the academy awards and the media frenzy that surrounds it, she accepts that it has opened doors for her. ""people will definitely listen to what i want to do now, and the phone didn't stop ringing for a week after i got nominated."" as for the future, arnold firmly believes that you often get a stronger vision of the world with short films. ""you're left more to your own devices, without people interfering as much."" that said, she is currently working on a feature film with dogville and dancer in the dark director lars von trier.

2223,"high fuel prices hit ba's profits

british airways has blamed high fuel prices for a 40% drop in profits.

reporting its results for the three months to 31 december 2004, the airline made a pre-tax profit of â£75m ($141m) compared with â£125m a year earlier. rod eddington, ba's chief executive, said the results were ""respectable"" in a third quarter when fuel costs rose by â£106m or 47.3%. ba's profits were still better than market expectation of â£59m, and it expects a rise in full-year revenues.

to help offset the increased price of aviation fuel, ba last year introduced a fuel surcharge for passengers.

in october, it increased this from â£6 to â£10 one-way for all long-haul flights, while the short-haul surcharge was raised from â£2.50 to â£4 a leg. yet aviation analyst mike powell of dresdner kleinwort wasserstein says ba's estimated annual surcharge revenues - â£160m - will still be way short of its additional fuel costs - a predicted extra â£250m. turnover for the quarter was up 4.3% to â£1.97bn, further benefiting from a rise in cargo revenue. looking ahead to its full year results to march 2005, ba warned that yields - average revenues per passenger - were expected to decline as it continues to lower prices in the face of competition from low-cost carriers. however, it said sales would be better than previously forecast. ""for the year to march 2005, the total revenue outlook is slightly better than previous guidance with a 3% to 3.5% improvement anticipated,"" ba chairman martin broughton said. ba had previously forecast a 2% to 3% rise in full-year revenue.

it also reported on friday that passenger numbers rose 8.1% in january. aviation analyst nick van den brul of bnp paribas described ba's latest quarterly results as ""pretty modest"". ""it is quite good on the revenue side and it shows the impact of fuel surcharges and a positive cargo development, however, operating margins down and cost impact of fuel are very strong,"" he said. since the 11 september 2001 attacks in the united states, ba has cut 13,000 jobs as part of a major cost-cutting drive.

297,"blair says uk tsunami aid to soar

tony blair has predicted the british government will eventually give ""hundreds of millions"" of pounds in aid to countries hit by the tsunami.

the prime minister was speaking publicly for the first time since returning from his holiday in egypt. mr blair insisted he had been ""intimately involved"" in ""all decisions at all times"" despite being abroad. he was speaking before the uk joins a three-minute silence at noon across the eu for the estimated 150,000 dead.

the foreign office says 41 britons are now confirmed to have died in the tsunami which struck south asia on boxing day, with 158 others missing. asked about criticism that he did not cut short his holiday, mr blair told bbc radio 4's today programme: ""i don't think this is a situation in which the british people need me to articulate what they feel.

""i think they feel - as we all do - shock, horror, and absolute solidarity with those people who have lost their lives."" the important thing was action and not words, he said, adding that of the â£50m given by the government so far only ""six or seven million"" had been spent. it would become easier in the coming weeks to assess just how much money would have to be put in. ""my estimate is we will need to spend from government several hundred million pounds. so we will far and away more than match the generosity of the british people,"" he said. asked whether he had not returned to work immediately because he was under doctors orders to rest, mr blair said there was also a story he had been away for plastic surgery. ""as you can see unfortunately i am still looking the same as i always did,"" he joked.

the prime minister took personal charge of the uk's response on tuesday, chairing a meeting of the emergency committee of ministers that has convened daily since boxing day. he also spoke on the telephone to us president george bush, and the presidents of sri lanka and indonesia. chancellor gordon brown earlier backed a plan to freeze the foreign debts of all the affected nations.

mr brown, who was not at the downing street meeting, says he has been in ""intensive talks"" with other g8 finance ministers. germany proposed a freeze last week and canada has begun its own moratorium. the chancellor said the plan would initially save the most affected countries about $3bn (â£1.58bn) in repayments. tory leader michael howard also backed the proposals but said ministers had been ""playing catch-up"" with public donations.

foreign secretary jack straw is to visit thailand and indonesia this week. during his trip, mr straw will represent the g8 at the international conference called in jakarta, indonesia on thursday. on friday, he will visit the thai beach resort of phuket, where british families are still searching for relatives.

international development secretary hilary benn will also visit aceh in indonesia, as well as sri lanka. the british public has now pledged â£76m in aid with emergency supplies from the british government starting to arrive in the region on three raf flights in a joint operation with scandinavian countries. two ships - the royal fleet auxiliary ship diligence and frigate hms chatham - have arrived in the disaster area. a second royal fleet auxiliary vessel, the bayleaf, is also being sent. uk charities have also begun chartering planes to deliver aid.

the champions only just saw off the scots in paris, then needed england to self-destruct in last week's 18-17 win. ""the english played better than us but lost, whereas we are still in the race for the grand slam,"" said dominici. ""we know our display was not perfect, but we can still win the grand slam, along with ireland and wales."" france , ireland and wales all remain unbeaten after two rounds of this year's rbs six nations, with the two celtic nations playing by far the more impressive rugby.

france take on wales at the stade de france on 26 february and ireland in dublin on 12 march. but although france have yet to click, dominici says that they can still win the hard way as long as scrum-half dimitri yachvili continues in his goalkicking form. ""if we have an efficient kicker on whom we can rely on, a solid defence and a team who play for their lives, we can achieve something,"" dominici added. ""i said at the start of the competition that the winners would be clearer from the third matches, and that's exactly what is going to happen."" france coach bernard laporte will announce his starting line-up next tuesday for the match against wales.

wing jimmy marlu is definitely out with the knee injury sustained at twickenham, which is likely to sideline him for the rest of the tournament. inspirational flanker serge betsen is a doubt with a thigh injury, but number eight imanol harinordoquy has shaken off his shoulder injury. in the backs, centre yannick jauzion and winger aurelien rougerie are all back in contention after injury, while brive back julien laharrague has received his first call-up as a replacement for pepito elhorga.

british telecom has said it will double the broadband speeds of most of its home and business customers.

the increased speeds will come at no extra charge and follows a similar move by internet service provider aol. many bt customers will now have download speeds of 2mbps, although there are usage allowances of between one gigabyte and 30 gigabytes a month. the new speeds start to come into effect on 17 february for home customers and 1 april for businesses. ""britain is now broadband britain,"" said duncan ingram, bt's managing director, broadband and internet services. he added: ""ninety percent of our customers will see real increases in speed.

""these speed increases will give people the opportunity to do a lot more with their broadband connections,"" he said. upload speeds - the speed at which information is sent from a pc via broadband - will remain at the same speed, said mr ingram. despite the increases, bt will continue to have usage allowances for home customers. ""the allowances are extremely generous,"" said mr ingram ""for what we are seeing in the market place - they are really not an issue."" bt will begin enforcing the allowances in the summer. customers who exceed the amounts will either be able to pay for a bigger allowance or see their download speeds reduced. bt now has a 36% share of the broadband market - down from 39% - which is becoming increasingly competitive. in the last few months, many rival isps have begun to offer 2mbps services, including aol, plusnet and uk online.

but britain continues to lag behind some countries - especially japan and south korea - which offer broadband speeds of up to 40mbps. but mr ingram said it was important to ""separate hype from reality"". he said that a limited number of people with those connections consistently received speeds of 40mbps. customers will not see their connections double immediately on 17 february. mr ingram said there would be a roll out across the network in order to prevent any problems.

1480,"greer attacks 'bully' big brother

germaine greer has criticised celebrity big brother's ""bullying"" of housemates after quitting the reality tv show.

she said ""superior"" bullying tactics, like making housemates cold and hungry, could encourage playground bullying. she also condemned the ""complete irresponsibility"" of adding brigitte nielsen's former mother-in-law jackie stallone to the house on monday. nielsen had panicked that if she reacted badly it could harm her access to her children, greer said. the feminist writer and broadcaster said big brother had behaved ""like a child rather than a parent"" by taunting contestant john mccririck after denying him a cola drink. ""i thought it was actually demonstrating the role of taunting in the playground and there are so many children whose lives have actually been destroyed by taunting in the playground,"" greer said. she also said that her fellow housemates had publicity-seeking ""agendas"".

""i had no idea who would be in here and it's wrong for me to present myself in the same context as they are."" media observers had been surprised by greer's initial decision to join the third celebrity version of the channel 4 reality tv show, given that she has written critical articles about the format in the past. as she packed her suitcase to leave the house she told fellow housemates: ""i'm leaving over specific issues, but best for everyone if i don't discuss them. ""i have a problem with decisions, i make them fast and when i make them, i stick to them."" greer had earlier failed to persuade other contestants to stage a naked protest against big brother.

other celebrities to walk out of a reality show tv include sex pistol john lydon, former eastenders actress danniella westbrook and ex-e17 singer brian harvey who all left i'm a celebrity... get me out of here. previous big brother housemates to leave before their time were sunita sharma and sandy cumming from the third series of the non-celebrity version of the show.

happy mondays dancer bez is now 2-1 favourite to win the show, followed by blazin' squad singer kenzie at 5-2 and actor jeremy edwards at 4-1. ladbrokes spokesman warren lush said that the series was still ""wide open"", adding that the last 24 hours had also seen a rush of bets on mccririck slashing his odds to 8-1. dj lisa i'anson is the outsider with odds of 40-1, while jackie stallone, who joined the house on monday, is also one of the less popular housemates at 20-1. the first eviction of the series has now been postponed after greer's exit unexpectedly reduced the number of competitors. the eight remaining contestants are competing for a â£50,000 prize, to be donated to the charity of their choice, if they survive a series of public votes. for every 50p vote cast by viewers by telephone or text during the programme's run, 9p will go to a tsunami charity appeal.

children would be offered two hours' free sports training a week by a future tory government, the party has said.

the club2school policy would provide up to â£250m yearly for local sports clubs in the uk to deliver after-school sport. the extra coaching would be funded by the national lottery and would come on top of the two hours of sport a week children are supposed to get in school. shadow home secretary david davis said five million children were being denied adequate sporting opportunities.

the plans would help tackle the ""fastest growing rate of obesity in the developed world"", he said. shadow sports minister lord moynihan said the policy would empower local clubs and create a lasting legacy. ""we aim to shift the emphasis on after-school sport provision away from our overstretched teachers and schools directly in to the 151,000 sports clubs in the uk."" the tories say labour's plans to give all children two hours of sports lessons a week in schools have failed. government figures show that in england in 2002 only a third of schools at key stages 1, 3 and 4 and two-fifths of schools at key stage 2, met that target. the tories also claim that of the â£750m the prime minister pledged in 2000 to invest on school sports facilities, only â£41m had been spent. but the big lottery fund has said that complex capital projects are involved - and it was confident the money would all be allocated by next year as intended.

the bbc should steer away from ""demonising"" ex-downing street media chief alastair campbell, peter mandelson has said.

the european commissioner and former labour minister was speaking amid claims that mr campbell is part of a labour ""dirty tricks"" campaign. that charge was denied by mr mandelson, who said the tories were afraid of mr campbell's campaigning skills. he warned the bbc that attacking mr campbell had brought it trouble before. that was a reference to the hutton inquiry following a bbc story claiming downing street ""sexed up"" iraq's weapons of mass destruction dossier.

the affair prompted the resignation of bbc chairman gavyn davies, director-general greg dyke and reporter andrew gilligan. labour has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about tory leader michael howard's past.

mr mandelson, a former labour communications director, told bbc radio 4's today programme: ""i understand why the tories will be gunning for alastair campbell because they fear his campaigning skills. ""what i understand less is why the bbc should be joining with the tories in driving that agenda. ""in my experience of these things, parties which shout about dirty tricks and the like tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their political anatomy. ""i suggest the bbc concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics, the trivialisation of the campaign. ""i think the bbc would be much better advised to leave all this stuff well alone, concentrate on the issues as i say, not resume their demonisation of alastair campbell - we all know where that led before.""

mr campbell is acting as an adviser for labour, which denies engaging in personal campaigning. conservative co-chairman liam fox said mr campbell's return and labour poster plans attacking mr howard - recently withdrawn from the party's website - were a sign of ""abusive politics"". ""the government, despite the fact that they would say want to go forward, not back, seem intent on talking about history rather than their own record or even more importantly, about the future,"" he said on sunday. labour peer baroness kennedy, who is chairing the power inquiry into political disengagement, said people already thought politicians engaged in dirty tricks. ""this feeling of distrust is going to be enlarged if this campaigning on all sides is conducted in the way that it looks as if it just might,"" she said.

leisure group rank could unveil plans to demerge its film services unit and sell its media business, reports claim.

rank, formerly famous for the carry on series, will expose the shake-up at the announcement of its results on friday, the sunday telegraph reported. advisors goldman sachs are understood to have valued its demerged deluxe film unit at â£300m, the report added. speculation of a possible shake-up has mounted since rank announced a study into a possible demerger in september. since mike smith's appointment as chief executive in 1999, the group has focused on fewer businesses and embarked on a major cost-cutting programme which has seen it dispose of a number of businesses, including the odeon cinema chain and the pinewood studios. the move left the group with three core divisions: gaming, hard rock and deluxe films, which provides technical services to hollywood studios.

rank now aims to concentrate on its gaming, bars and hotels business, including extending its hard rock brand to its casinos - trials of which have been a success. it also owns deluxe media, which makes and distributes dvds and videos. however, that business is seen as less successful. last year it made profits of â£21.5m on a turnover of â£392.1m and experts suggest its success in moving to dvds from vhs video could make it an attractive target for a private equity buyer. a spokesman for the firm refused to comment on the reports, but said any results from the demerger study were likely to be set out when it unveiled its results on friday. analysts predict the firm is likely to report a slight drop in annual pre-tax profits to â£170m from â£194m last year. formed in the 1940s the firm was a leading uk film producer and cinema owner for many years. it has now diversified into a range of other leisure activities - mainly in the uk - including hotels, roadside service areas and holiday centres. it now owns 34 grosvenor casinos, the mecca bingo chain and more than 100 hard rock cafes in 38 countries.

tony blair has promised that ""sport is back"" as a priority for schools.

the prime minister launched a â£500m initiative to allow school sports clubs in england to provide up to three hours of extra activity a week by 2010. ""it's an important part of education and it's an important part of health,"" mr blair said. but the conservatives say government proposals - which include two hours' pe within school for 75% of pupils by 2006 - are unrealistic.

the latest move is aimed at encouraging more diversity in sport, with activities such as yoga and tai chi being options. launching the initiative, mr blair completed an agility course and shot basketball hoops with students from the all-girl waverley sports college in southwark, south london. he said: ""you've got to bring back school sport. it's got to be done differently than it was 30 or 40 years ago. it's still very, very important.""

earlier, education secretary charles clarke told bbc news there were at least three areas which needed ""a coherent framework"" and ""dedicated funding"". these were training for pe teachers, establishing more specialist schools and the development of partnerships for activities such as inter-school competitions. he added the government had originally pledged ""for every pupil to get at least two hours of high-quality physical education"" a week. the proportion was currently at 62%, and the government was hoping this would rise to 85% by 2008 and 100% by 2010. the money for the initiative will come from a new â£500m fund.

the â£500m move will also increase the number of specialist sport colleges from 350 to 400. but the conservatives warned of rising obesity levels and said that since only a third of children do two hours of sport a week currently, the government is promising something it cannot guarantee. shadow spokesman for sport hugh robertson said: ""i suspect the correct way to tackle it is to look at the other end of the spectrum and try to enable the clubs - which is where the real passion for sport exists - to deliver the school sport offer."" he said more emphasis should be put on traditional sports, saying that an ""anti-competitive sport agenda"" had been pursued in recent years. martin ward, of the secondary heads association, said members did not like ""ring-fenced funds"" and that it should be up to the schools themselves to decide how to spend their money.

the news came as deutsche boerse held its third meeting with the lse since its bid approach in december which was turned down by the london exchange for undervaluing the business. however, the lse did agree to leave the door open for talks to find out whether a ""significantly-improved proposal"" would be in the interests of lse's shareholders and customers. in the meantime, euronext, which combines the paris, amsterdam and lisbon stock exchanges, also began talks with the lse. in a statement on thursday, euronext said any offer was likely to be solely in cash, but added that: ""there can be no assurances at this stage that any offer will be made."" a deal with either bidder would create the biggest stock market operator in europe and the second biggest in the world after the new york stock exchange. however, neither side has made a formal offer for the lse, with sources claiming such a step may still be weeks away.

deutsche boerse could also face mounting opposition to a bid at home. among sweeteners reported to have been discussed by mr seifert with ms furse were plans to move the management of its cash and eurex derivatives market to london, as well as two members of its executive board. but, hans reckers, a board member of germany's central bank, the bundesbank, said that cash trading should also remain in frankfurt, something deutsche boerse could move to the uk. ""it is not just the headquarters of the boerse but also important market segments that must stay permanently in frankfurt. this has special importance for the business activities of the banks and the consultants,"" he said. local government officials in frankfurt's state of hessen have also spoken out against the move. ""it is our wish that the headquarters stay here to maintain frankfurt's standing as the number one financial centre in continental europe,"" alois rhiel, its minister for economic affairs added.

2171,"lufthansa flies back to profit

german airline lufthansa has returned to profit in 2004 after posting huge losses in 2003.

in a preliminary report, the airline announced net profits of 400m euros ($527.61m; â£274.73m), compared with a loss of 984m euros in 2003. operating profits were at 380m euros, ten times more than in 2003. lufthansa was hit in 2003 by tough competition and a dip in demand following the iraq war and the killer sars virus. it was also hit by troubles at its us catering business. last year, lufthansa showed signs of recovery even as some european and us airlines were teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. the board of lufthansa has recommended paying a 2004 dividend of 0.30 euros per share. in 2003, shareholders did not get a dividend. the company said that it will give all the details of its 2004 results on 23 march.

942,"concerns over windows atms

cash machine networks could soon be more susceptible to computer viruses, a security firm has warned.

the warning is being issued because many banks are starting to use the windows operating system in machines. already there have been four incidents in which windows viruses have disrupted networks of cash machines running the microsoft operating system. but banking experts say the danger is being overplayed and that the risks of infection and disruption are small.

for many years the venerable ibm operating system, known as os/2, has been the staple software used to power many of the 1.4m cash machines in operation around the world. but ibm will end support for os/2 in 2006 which is forcing banks to look for alternatives. there are also other pressures making banks turn to windows said dominic hirsch, managing director of financial analysis firm retail banking research.

he said many cash machines will also have to be upgraded to make full use of the new europay, mastercard and visa credit cards that use computer chips instead of magnetic stripes to store data. us laws that demand disabled people get equal access to information will also force banks to make their cash machines more versatile and able to present information in different ways. todd thiemann, spokesman for anti-virus firm trend micro, said the move to windows in cash machines was not without risks. mr thiemann said research by the towergroup showed that 70% of new cash machines being installed were windows based.

already, he said, there have been four incidents in which cash machines have been unavailable for hours due to viruses affecting the network of the bank that owns them.

in january 2003 the slammer worm knocked out 13,000 cash machines of the bank of america and many of those operated by the canadian imperial bank of commerce. in august of the same year, cash machines of two un-named banks were put out of action for hours following an infection by the welchia worm. incidents like this happen, said mr thiemann, because when banks start using windows cash machines they also change the networking technology used to link the devices to their back office computers. this often means that all the cash machines and computers in a bank share the same data network. ""this could mean that cash machines get caught up in the viruses that are going around because they have a common transmission system,"" he said. ""banks need to consider protection as part of the investment to maintain the security of that network,"" mr thiemann told bbc news online.

but mr hirsch from retail banking research said the number of cash machines actually at risk was low because so few were upgraded every year.

currently, he said, a cash machine has a lifetime of up to 10 years which means that only about 10% of all atms get swapped for a newer model every year. ""windows cash machines have been around for several years,"" he said. ""most banks simply upgrade as part of their usual replacement cycle."" ""in theory there is a bigger threat with windows than os/2,"" he said, ""but i do not think that the banks are hugely concerned at the moment."" ""it's pretty unusual to hear about virus problems with atms,"" he said. the many different security systems built-in to cash machines meant there was no chance that a virus could cause them to start spitting out cash spontaneously, he said. banks were more likely to be worried about internal networks being overwhelmed by worms and viruses and customers not being able to get cash out at all, he added. a spokesman for the association of payment and clearing services (apacs) which represents the uk's payments industry said the risk from viruses was minimal. ""there's no concern that there's going to be any type of virus hitting the uk networks,"" he said. risks of infection were small because the data networks that connect uk cash machines together and the operators of the atms themselves were a much smaller and tightly-knit community than in the us where viruses have struck.

945,"halo fans' hope for sequel

xbox video game halo 2 has been released in the us on 9 november, with a uk release two days later. why is the game among the most anticipated of all time?

halo is considered by many video game pundits to be one of the finest examples of interactive entertainment ever produced and more than 1.5 million people worldwide have pre-ordered the sequel. a science fiction epic, halo centred the action on a human cyborg, controlled by the player, who had to save his crew from an alien horde after a crash landing on a strange and exotic world contained on the interior surface of a giant ring in space. remembrance of things past it was not - but as a slice of schlock science fiction inspired by works such as larry niven's ringworld and the film starship troopers, it fit the bill perfectly. halo stood out from a crowd of similar titles - it was graphically impressive, had tremendous audio, using dolby digital, a decent storyline, instant playability and impressive physics.

but what marked halo as a classic were the thousands of details which brought a feeling of polish and the enormously-high production values not usually associated with video gaming.

produced by bungie software, renowned for their innovation in gaming, it caused a stir among the gaming fraternity when the developer was bought by microsoft and became an xbox exclusive. claude errera, editor of fansite halo.bungie.org, said: ""bungie got everything right. they were really careful to make sure everything worked the way it was supposed to. ""nothing distracts you when you were playing. there was nothing in halo that had not been done before but everything in there was as good as it could be."" he added: ""graphically it was superior to everything else out there.

""it also had a depth to it that made it stand out."" halo was unusually immersive, sucking the player into the action and blurring the interface between screen and controller. it also capitalised on the growing popularity of lan gaming in the pc world - for the first time it became easy to link multiple game consoles together, allowing up to 16 players to battle against each other at the same time.

the game instantly cultivated an online following, which continues today with a score of halo fan websites following every aspect of the sequel, halo 2. errera spends three to fours hours a day of his own time maintaining the hugely popular website, which attracts 600,000 page views a day from halo fans eager for the latest news.

when the xbox launched on november 15 2001 in the us, halo was one of the launch titles and had an immediate impact on critics and consumers. ""halo is the most important launch game for any console ever,"" wrote the influential edge magazine in its review, giving it a rare 10 out of 10 mark. the game had its critics and while it is not a one-off original as a game, it brought many original touches and flourishes to the genre which have defined all other first person shooters since. ""the first time i played it i just stood there watching the spent shells fall out of my gun,"" said errera, remarking on the level of detail in the game.

the game also inspired thousands of people to write their own fiction based on the storyline and produce downloadable video clips of the many weird and wonderful things that can be done in the game. ""it blew me away the first time someone managed to climb to the top of halo,"" said errera, referring to a fan who had created a video of master chief scaling the landscape of the graphical world. video clips of the more outrageous stunts that are possible thanks to the game's amazing physics engine are incredibly popular and some have attained a cult following. speculation about the sequel has seen every titbit analysed and poured over with all the intent of a forensic scientist examining a body. when early screenshots of the game were released some people wrote essay-length articles highlighting everything from the texture of graphics to clues about the story line. errera said expectations of the sequel among fans were sky high. ""it does not feel like a game release any more. somebody told me this was the biggest single release of any product in microsoft's history. ""we're all just hoping that bungie has got it right again.""

1882,"s korean lender faces liquidation

creditors of south korea's top credit card firm have said they will put the company into liquidation if its ex-parent firm fails to back a bail-out.

lg card's creditors have given lg group until wednesday to sign up to a $1.1bn rescue package. the firm avoided bankruptcy thanks to a $4.5bn bail-out in january 2004, which gave control to the creditors. lg group has said any package should reflect the firm's new ownership, and it will not accept an unfair burden. at least seven million people in south korea use lg card's plastic for purchases.

lg card's creditors have threatened parent group lg group with penalties if it fails to respond to their demands.

""creditors would seek strong financial sanctions against lg group if lg card is liquidated,"" said yoo ji-chang, governor of korean development bank (kdb) - one of the card firm's major creditors. lg group has said providing further help to the credit card issuer could hurt its corporate credibility and could spark shareholder lawsuits. it says it wants ""fair and reasonable guidelines"" on splitting the financial burden with the creditors, who now own 99.3% of lg card. the creditors have asked the government to mediate to avoid any risk to the stability of financial markets, kdb said. analysts believe a compromise is likely. ""lg group knows the impact on consumer demand and the national economy from a liquidation of lg card,"" said kim yungmin, an equity strategist at dongwon investment trust management.

lg card almost collapsed in 2003 due to an increase in overdue credit card bills after the bursting of a credit bubble. the firm returned to profit in september 2004, but now needs a capital injection to avoid being delisted from the korea stock exchange. the exchange can delist a company if its debt exceeds its assets for two years running. lg card's creditors fear that such a move would triggered massive debt redemption requests that could bankrupt the firm, which owes about $12.05bn. ""eventually, lg group will have to participate, but they have been stalling to try to earn better concessions,"" said mr kim.

1075,"confusion over high-definition tv

now that a critical mass of people have embraced digital tv, dvds, and digital video recorders, the next revolution for tv is being prepared for our sets.

in most corners of tv and technology industries, high-definition (hdtv) is being heralded as the biggest thing to happen to the television since colour. hd essentially makes tv picture quality at least four times better than now. but there is real concern that people are not getting the right information about hd on the high street. thousands of flat panel screens - lcds (liquid crystal displays), plasma screens, and dlp rear-projection tv sets - have already been sold as ""hd"", but are in fact not able to display hd.

""the uk is the largest display market in europe,"" according to john binks, director of gfk, which monitors global consumer markets.

but, he added: ""of all the flat panel screens sold, just 1.3% in the uk are capable of getting high-definition."" there are 74 different devices that are being sold as hd but are not hd-ready, according to alexander oudendijk, senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant astra. they may be fantastic quality tvs, but many do not have adaptors in them - called dvi or hdmi (high-definition multimedia interface) connectors - which let the set handle the higher resolution digital images. part of this is down to lack of understanding and training on the high street, say industry experts, who gathered at bafta in london for the 2nd european hdtv summit last week. ""we have to be careful about consumer confusion. there is a massive education process to go through,"" said mr binks. the industry already recognised that it would be a challenge to get the right information about it across to those of us who will be watching it. eventually, that will be everyone. the bbc is currently developing plans to produce all its tv output to meet hdtv standards by 2010.

preparations for the analogue switch-off are already underway in some areas, and programmes are being filmed with hd cameras. bskyb plans to ship its first generation set-top boxes, to receive hdtv broadcasts, in time for christmas. like its sky+ boxes, they will also be personal video recorders (pvrs). the company will start broadcasts of hdtv programmes, offering them as ""premium channel packages"", concentrating, to start with, on sports, big events, and films, in early 2006. but the set-top box which receives hdtv broadcasts has to plug into a display - tv set - that can show the images at the much higher resolution that hd demands, if hdtv is to be ""real"". by 2010, 20% of homes in the uk will have some sort of tv set or display that can show hd in its full glory.

but it is all getting rather confusing for people who have only just taken to ""being digital"". as a result, all the key players, those who make flat panel displays, as well as the satellite companies and broadcasters, formed a hd forum in 2004 to make sure they were all talking to each other. part of the forum has been concerned with issues like industry standards and content protection. but it has also been preoccupied with how to help the paying public know exactly what they are paying for.

from next month, all devices that have the right connectors and resolution required will carry a ""hd-ready"" sticker. this also means they are equipped to cope with both analogue and hdtv signals, and so comply with the minimum specification set out by the industry. ""the logo is absolutely the way forward,"" said david mercer, analysts with strategy analytics. ""but it is still not appearing on many retail products."" the industry is upbeat that the sticker will help, but it is only a start. ""we can only do so much with the position we are in today with manufacturers,"" said mr oudendijk. ""there may well be a number of dissatisfied customers in the next few months."" the european broadcast union (ebu) is testing different flavours of hd formats to prepare for even better hdtv further down the line. it is similarly concerned that people get the right information on hdtv formats, as well as which devices will support the formats. ""we believe consumers buying expensive displays need to ensure their investment is worthwhile,"" said phil laven, technical director for the ebu. the tv display manufacturers want us to watch hd on screens that are at least 42in (106cm), to get the ""true impact"" of hd, they say, although smaller displays suffice. what may convince people to spend money on hd-ready devices is the falling prices, which continue to tumble across europe. the prices are dropping an average of 20% every year, according to analysts. lcd prices dropped by 43% in europe as a whole last year, according to mr oudendijk.

193,"'uk will stand firm on eu rebate'

britain's â£3bn eu rebate is not up for renegotiation at next week's european council summit, jack straw said.

the foreign secretary told mps the rebate, secured by margaret thatcher in 1984, was ""entirely justified"". new european commission president jose manuel barroso has suggested the cash could be shared out among net contributors to the eu budget. mr straw acknowledged some countries in the newly enlarged 25 nation eu still had to ""see the light"" on the rebate.

but the foreign secretary told the commons foreign affairs committee: ""our position is very clear: it is entirely justified and it is not for negotiation."" he added that he did not think there would be a political price to pay for the uk's stance - britain contributed more and received less than other eu states. the two-day european council summit in brussels begins on 16 december and is widely expected to mark the beginning of a lengthy negotiating period over the eu's budget for 2007-13. the wrangling could stretch into 2005, even 2006.

the uk, france, germany, austria, the netherlands and sweden want the eu budget to be capped at 1% of member states' combined national incomes - the commission wants it to be 1.26%. mr straw said the eu commission's proposal would mean a 35% hike in the budget. ""i don't know of any national government thinking of increasing its budget by that amount,"" he added. the foreign secretary said he hoped the talks next week could produce a date in 2005 for the beginning of negotiations with turkey about possible eu membership although that there would be no prospect of a date for joining for some time.

181,"'no-one can define new hunt ban'

the new law banning hunting with dogs is ""so poorly drafted"" no-one can define the offence, pro-hunt mps say.

the accusation came after it emerged a devon man had been told he could use his four dogs to ""chase away unwanted animals"" from his farm. because he did not intend to kill deer or foxes it was not hunting. lib dem mp lembit opik said ministers had invented a new category of hunting - chasing away - and asked how police were supposed to interpret the rules.

north devon landowner giles bradshaw was put in touch with the middle way group, of which mr opik is a co-chairman, after he had been in contact with the rural affairs ministry, defra. he had asked whether his technique of using his four dogs to frighten off deer and foxes would be outlawed under the hunting act. mr bradshaw was initially told it was an offence - prompting him to complain. the middle way group also said mr bradshaw would be put in a position where he would have to buy a rifle to shoot animals that would have previously gone free. in a later conversation mr bradshaw was told that according to defra's lawyers chasing away unwanted animals was ""not in fact hunting as described in the hunting act 2004 therefore you would not be committing an offence"".

mr opik said: ""hunting with dogs and flushing are not defined in the hunting act. ""now defra have also invented a completely new category of hunting - 'chasing away' which isn't even covered by the act. ""however, all these activities involve the use of dogs to chase wild mammals. ""how is the village bobby who sees a group of people with dogs supposed to distinguish between illegal hunting, exempt hunting, drag hunting, unintentional hunting, a hunt exercising hounds or simply chasing away?"" tory mp peter luff, another co-chairman of middle way, said that the legislation was ""so poorly drafted nobody appears able to properly define the offence"".

""it is no wonder the government desperately wants to move on from this disastrous law. however, i seriously doubt the countryside will be that accommodating."" mike hobday, of the league against cruel sports, said: ""there is no confusion, it is a matter of simple common sense. ""if mr bradshaw is setting his dogs to chase wild animals then he is hunting them and that will be a criminal offence.

899,"ireland 17-12 south africa

ronan o'gara scored all ireland's points as the home side claimed only their second ever win over south africa on an emotional day at lansdowne road.

o'gara's first-half try, poached after a quick tap-penalty, helped the irish to a 8-3 lead at half-time. three further o'gara penalties extended ireland's lead to 17-6 as the game entered the final quarter. two percy montgomery penalties set up a frantic finish but ireland held out to claim a famous victory. ireland began strongly and were never led, but the match was tense and closely fought throughout. aware of the threat posed by the south africans, ireland pressed hard from the outset, and played some impressive rugby while searching for a breakthrough. early on, denis hickie thought he was in for a try after a delightful backline move but shane horgan's pass was adjudged to have gone forward by referee paul honiss.

ireland continued to press and they showed their intent by opting for a line-out in the 19th minute when three straight-forward points were on offer. another south african infringement a minute later led to ireland's first points - o'gara took a quick tap-penalty and charged over the opposition line for an irish try. the springboks could feel hard done by as captain john smit had his back to the play when o'gara pounced after referee honiss had told the skipper to warn his own players after consistent infringements. stung by the score, the south africans almost replied with a try of their own within 60 seconds with geordan murphy's ankle-tap tackle denying a certain try for percy montgomery. however, the springboks did win a penalty a minute later which montgomery easily slotted to cut ireland's lead to 5-3.

ireland got out of jail when the south africans had a three-to-one overlap near the irish line only to waste the chance. after the sustained springboks pressure, the irish produced an attack of their own in the 34th minute which culminated with o'gara's clever drop-goal to restore his side's lead to five points which remained the margin at half-time. sustained irish pressure immediately after half-time was rewarded by another o'gara penalty. however, montgomery responded quickly by slotting over a superb penalty from near the right touchline to cut ireland's lead to five points again. montgomery then burst through the irish defence in the 48th minute and it took a superb girvan dempsey tackle to prevent a try. the south africans suffered a double-blow in the 52nd minute when schalk burger was sin-binned for the second week in a row after killing the ball and o'gara punished the transgression by notching another penalty.

in the 61st minute, hickie was left frustrated by a poor pass from girvan dempsey as a chance to seal the match was wasted. however, a late tackle on brian o'driscoll enabled o'gara to notch another penalty in the 63rd minute which extended ireland's lead to 17-6. however, two montgomery penalties had ireland's lead in peril again as the springboks closed to within five points with seven minutes remaining. south africa produced a huge effort in the closing minutes but ireland held on to claim a deserved victory.

2095,"aids and climate top davos agenda

climate change and the fight against aids are leading the list of concerns for the first day of the world economic forum in the swiss resort of davos.

some 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe will listen to uk prime minister tony blair's opening speech on wednesday. mr blair will focus on africa's development plans and global warming. earlier in the day came an update on efforts to have 3 million people on anti-aids drugs by the end of 2005. the world health organisation (who) said 700,000 people in poor countries were on life-extending drugs - up from 440,000 six months earlier but amounting to only 12% of the 5.8 million who needed them. a $2bn ""funding gap"" still stood in the way of hitting the 2005 target, the who said.

the themes to be stressed by mr blair - whose attendance was announced at the last minute - are those he wants to dominate the uk's chairmanship of the g8 group of industrialised states. other issues to be discussed at the five-day conference range from china's

economic power to iraq's future after this sunday's elections. aside from mr blair, more than 20 other world leaders are expected to attend including french president jacques chirac - due to speak by video link after bad weather delayed his helicopter - and south african president thabo mbeki, whose arrival has been delayed by ivory coast peace talks. the ukraine's new president, viktor yushchenko, will also be there - as will newly elected palestinian leader mahmoud abbas. showbiz figures will also put in an appearance, from u2 frontman bono - a well-known campaigner on trade and development issues - to angelina jolie, a goodwill campaigner for the un on refugees.

unlike previous years, protests against the wef are expected to be muted. anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend. at the same time, about 100,000 people are expected to converge on the brazilian resort of porto alegre for the world social forum - the so-called ""anti-davos"" for campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes.

in contrast, the davos forum is dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world's 500 largest companies scheduled to attend. a survey published on the eve of the conference by pricewaterhousecoopers said four in ten business leaders were ""very confident"" that their companies would see sales rise in 2005. asian and american executives, however, were much more confident than their european counterparts. but the political discussions, focusing on iran, iraq and china, are likely to dominate media attention.

242,"clarke defends terror detentions

the home secretary has defended his decision not to release foreign terror suspects despite a legal ruling their detention breached human rights laws.

house of lords law lords ruled against the detention measures last week. they said it was wrong to have one set of laws for foreign suspects and another for british suspects. new home secretary charles clarke said he would carefully consider the ruling and would return to parliament early in the new year with proposals.

he insisted that he would not be rushed into judgement but would examine the law lords' findings in detail. ""my duty is to look at first of all the security of this country and in so doing to consider very carefully the precise legal measures that there are."" mr clarke's comments came in response to an emergency question from liberal democrat constitutional affairs spokesman david heath. mr heath said the judgement contained ""unprecedented condemnation and could not have been more unequivocal"". he said he accepted the difficult balance between the nation's security and human rights but questioned why the home office had made ""no contingency plans for the present circumstances"".

""these detainees should be prosecuted and tried. simply renewing the present deeply unsatisfactory legislation is not an option."" shadow home secretary david davis said it was not possible to overstate the importance of the judgment and urged the government to move as fast as ""competently possible"" to sort the problem out in the interests of natural justice. ""if you do, we will give you every support."" the law lords' ruling came on charles clarke's first day as home secretary last thursday following david blunkett's resignation. in a statement on the same day, mr clarke said: ""i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year. ""in the meantime, we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords.""

but the government was widely criticised for insisting the detentions would continue following the ruling last week. lord bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions ""in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status"" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not britons. lord nicholls of birkenhead, in his ruling, said: ""indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law."" the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us.

net browser opera 8.0, due for official release at the end of next month, will be ""the most accessible browser on the market"", according to its authors.

the latest version of the net browser can be controlled by voice command and will read pages aloud. the voice features, based on ibm technology, are currently only available in the windows version. opera can also magnify text by up to 10 times and users can create ""style sheets"", its developers say. this will enable them to view pages with colours and fonts that they prefer. but the browser does not yet work well with screen reader software often used by blind people, so its accessibility features are more likely to appeal to those with some residual vision. ""our mission was always to provide the best internet experience for everyone,"" said opera spokeswoman, berit hanson. ""so we would obviously not want to exclude disabled computer users.""

another feature likely to appeal to people with low vision is the ability to make pages fit to the screen width, which eliminates the need for horizontal scrolling.

the company points out that this will also appeal to anyone using opera with a handheld device. the company says that features like voice activation are not solely aimed at visually impaired people. ""our idea was to take a first step in making human-computer interaction more natural,"" said ms hanson. ""people are not always in a situation where they can access a keyboard, so this makes the web a more hands-free experience."" unlike commercially available voice recognition software, opera does not have to be ""trained"" to recognise an individual voice. around 50 voice commands are available and users will have to wear a headset which incorporates a microphone. the voice recognition function is currently only available in english. opera is free to download but a paid-for version comes without an ad banner in the top right hand corner and with extra support. opera began life as a research project - a spin-off from norwegian telecoms company telenor. its browser is used by an estimated 10 million people on a variety of operating systems and a number of different platforms.

1335,"ten-year tragedy of missing manic

richey edwards, guitarist and lyricist for the manic street preachers, vanished 10 years ago, on 1 february 1995. his disappearance remains one of the most tragic mysteries in rock music.

for his devoted fans, richey edwards was an inspired and inspiring poet, a man who articulated their desperation and despair, who shouted the things most kept hidden. the manic street preachers may only have become stadium-conquering rock giants since his disappearance - but edwards was the figurehead for their first, dangerous and dazzling incarnation. edwards did not feature in the original line-up of the band, though. singer/guitarist james dean bradfield, bassist nicky wire and drummer sean moore were originally accompanied by a rhythm guitarist called flicker. but edwards replaced flicker in time for the band's self-financed debut, suicide alley, after designing the record's artwork.

after becoming a full-time member, edwards became a critical part of the band, writing lyrics and playing guitar - though in many concerts, he was not actually plugged in. but the fiercely intelligent edwards - who name-checked writers such as sylvia plath, george orwell and philip larkin - battled depression, alcohol problems, eating disorders, and self-harm. by the time the band released their third album, the holy bible, in october 1994, edwards had been admitted to hospital with depression. but in his last interview a few months later, seemed to be making plans for the future.

edwards walks out of the embassy hotel in london in the early morning, ahead of the band's us tour to promote the holy bible. in the following days, police issue a missing person alert and his parents, graham and sherry, plead for their son to let them know he is safe and well.

police discover edwards' car in a car park near the severn bridge near bristol - a notorious suicide spot. the discovery leads many to believe he has killed himself. the rest of the band stop touring and recording.

the band play their first concerts since edwards' disappearance as a trio, performing support slots for the stone roses on their uk stadium tour.

the manic street preachers release their first music since edwards' disappearance. a design for life reaches number two in the uk singles chart. the album everything must go follows.

the manics win best band and best album for everything must go at the brit awards.

a fan says she saw edwards in the hippy resort of goa, india. interpol are alerted but do not track him down.

graham and sherry edwards fly to the spanish island of fuerteventura six weeks after reports a man fitting their son's description has been seen in a bar called underground. the report comes to nothing.

edwards' sister rachel makes an emotional tv appeal five years after the disappearance. ""i'd just like to say to him if he is able to listen that we do love him very much and we'd like him to come back - me, mum and dad,"" she said.

the band play a concert in the cuban capital, havana - the first contemporary western rock band to play there.

on the seventh anniversary of his disappearance, police offer edwards' parents the opportunity to sign a death certificate. they refuse. the big issue magazine, which supports homelessness charities, prints the last known picture of edwards in a fresh plea for information.

a pair of trainers containing human bones washed up on the banks of the river severn have no link to edwards, police say.

the last song written by edwards - a song called judge y'self, which was to have been used for the judge dredd film soundtrack - is released on the b-side compilation lipstick traces. a skeleton found by the river severn is not edwards, tests reveal.

the manics' seventh studio album, lifeblood, features a song dedicated to edwards called cardiff afterlife.

the remaining manic street preachers members continue to pay a quarter of the band's royalties into an account held in his name.

260,"tory leader unveils spending plan

tory leader michael howard says his party can save â£35bn in government spending by tackling waste.

the money would be ploughed back into frontline services like the nhs and schools with the rest used to cut government borrowing and reduce taxes. the tory leader has also shrugged off the defection of one of his mps, robert jackson, a former minister, to labour. mr howard said that these things happened in politics and it would not affect the outcome of the election. ""let's be realistic - the election is not going to be decided on the basis of what mr jackson did"", he told bbc 1's breakfast with frost programme. however the defection on saturday has cast a shadow over the launch of the conservatives' spending plans. fuller details are due to be unveiled on monday.

the bulk of the â£35bn saved by tackling bureaucracy and inefficient systems will go back into frontline services, mr howard said. the â£12bn left over would then be spent on reducing government borrowing, he added. however, the remainder would deal with some of the ""unfair taxes"". ""almost every independent expert says if you get another labour government you are going to have to pay higher taxes,"" mr howard insisted. ""because borrowing is going up, it is out of control, that is bound to lead to higher taxes or higher interest rates or both. ""so part of the â£12bn we are going to apply to filling the government's black hole, reducing the borrowing. ""the rest will be used to reduce these unfair taxes which are bearing so heavily on the people of our country today.""

mr howard is expected to say that around â£6bn will be available for tax cuts when he makes his announcement on monday. the cuts will be paid for out of the savings identified by business trouble-shooter david james. home office spending could be cut by â£1.6bn, according to the final instalment of his year-long review. savings of â£153m at the foreign office and â£336m at the department for culture media and sport, have also been identified. in all, almost a quarter of a million jobs and 168 public bodies would go under mr james' proposals.

mr howard said: ""all this adds up to a bottom line and the bottom line is at this election people will have a clear choice between mr blair, who will waste more and tax more, and a conservative government that will give them value for money and tax less."" however, chief treasury secretary paul boateng said: ""none of the tories' figures add up so they can't make these savings and can't pay for any tax cuts, which means the only guaranteed cut from the tories is â£35bn of cuts, hitting frontline public services hard."" liberal democrat leader charles kennedy added: ""people will not be taken in by michael howard's claims of â£35bn worth of savings. ""this can't be achieved without drastic cuts in local services in their own communities."" a poll for the news of the world newspaper suggests the conservatives are on course for their worst election defeat in a century. labour will hold key marginal constituencies, winning a majority of 160, the populus survey suggests. and the liberal democrats will take three key seats from the conservatives, leaving the tories with just 163 mps, two less than they returned atlabour's 1997 landslide and their worst showing since 1906.

956,"no half measures with half-life 2

could half-life 2 possibly live up to the hype? after almost two years of tantalising previews and infuriating delays it's safe to say that this is the most highly-anticipated computer game of all time.

fortunately, it doesn't merely live up to its promise, but exceeds it. no-one who plays the finished product will wonder why it took so long. the impression is of a game that has been endlessly refined to get as close to perfection as could realistically be hoped. all the money - or indeed time - is on the screen. the player sees things through the eyes of gordon freeman, the bespectacled scientist who starred in the original 1998 half-life. having survived that skirmish in an desolate monster-infested research facility, he's back in another foreboding troublespot - the enigmatic city 17. it has the look of a beautiful eastern european city, but as soon as your train pulls in to the station, it's clear that all is not well here. sinister police patrol the unkempt streets, and the oppressive atmosphere clobbers you like a sledgehammer. a casual smattering of the nightmarish creatures from the first game makes this an even less pleasant place to be.

you are herded around like a prisoner and have to mingle with a few freedom-fighting civilians to gather information and progress in your task. it is not immediately explained what your objectives are, nor precisely why everything is so ravaged. finding out step-by-step is all part of the experience, although you never fully get to understand what it was all about. that does not really matter. hl2 does not waste energy blinding you with plot. underplaying the narrative in this way is gloriously effective, and immerses the player in the most vivid, convincing and impressive virtual world they are likely to have seen. there are no cut-scenes to interrupt the flow. exposition is accomplished by other characters stopping to talk directly to you.

whereas the highly impressive doom iii felt like a top-notch theme park thrill-ride, wandering through half-life's world truly does feel like being part of a movie.

considering its sophistication, the game runs surprisingly well on computers that only just match the modest minimum specifications. but if ever there was an incentive to upgrade your pc's components, this is it. on our test machine - an alienware system with an athlon 3500+ processor and ati's radeon x800 video card - everything ran at full quality without trouble, and the visual experience was simply jaw-dropping. it is not simply that the surfaces, textures and light effects push the technical envelope without mercy, but that such care and artistic flair has gone into designing them. the haunting, grim landscapes become strangely beautiful. luckily you get time to pause mid-task and marvel at the awesome graphical flourishes of your surroundings. so impressive are the physics that you'll find yourself hurling bits of rubbish around and prodding floating corpses just to marvel at the lifelike way they move. there are puzzles to be solved along the way, pitched at about the right difficulty, but most progress is achieved by force. freeman is quickly reunited with the original game's famous crowbar, and an array of more sophisticated weapons soon follow.

virtually anything not nailed to the floor can be interacted with, and in realistic fashion. you will be wowed by the attention-to-detail as you chip bits of plaster off walls, chase a pigeon out of your way, or dodge exploding barrels as they ping around at deadly speed. at times half-life 2 feels like one of those annoying people who are unfeasibly brilliant at everything they turn their hand to, and in a curious way, its unrelenting goodness actually becomes almost tiresome. running around on foot is great enough, but jumping into vehicles proves even more fun. human foes are rendered just as well as alien ones. the stealth sections are as exhilarating as the open gun battles. in gameplay terms, hl2 somehow gets almost everything perfect. and without resorting to the zombies-leaping-out-of-shadows approach of doom iii, it's all incredibly unsettling. the vacant environment is distinctly eerie, and at one point i even caught myself hesitating to go down a murky tunnel for fear of what might be inside.

the game does have a couple of problems. firstly, the carefully-scripted way that you progress through each level might irk some people.

a lot of things are meticulously choreographed to happen on cue, which makes for exciting moments, but may be an annoyance to some players and limit the appeal of playing again once you've completed it. if you like things open-ended and free-ranging, far cry will be a lot more pleasing. but the real downside is the hassle of getting the game to run. installing it proved a life-draining siege that would test a saint's patience. developer valve has rashly assumed that everyone wanting to play the game will have an internet connection and it forces you to go online to authenticate your copy. the box does warn you of this anti-piracy measure, but does not say just how many components have to be downloaded. the time spent doing this will depend on your connection speed, the temperamental valve servers and the time of day, but it can take hours. it would take a mighty piece of work to feel worthwhile after such annoyances - but luckily, half-life 2 is up to the challenge. it is surely the best thing in its genre, and possibly, many will feel, of any genre. the bar has been raised, and so far out of sight that you have to sympathise with any game that tries to do anything remotely similar in the near future.

397,"uk plan to deport terror suspects

deals are being sought to allow the uk to deport terror suspects to their home countries without risk of them being tortured or sentenced to death.

home secretary charles clarke told the times he hoped agreement with several countries could be reached. the move follows a law lords judgement that the detention of 12 men at belmarsh prison, london, and woodhill, milton keynes, was unlawful. the 12 affected by the ruling are from algeria, tunisia, egypt and jordan. the government was told that using anti-terror legislation brought in after 11 september to hold the men indefinitely without charge broke human rights laws.

mr clarke told the times: ""i think we should be prosecuting much more energetically our ability to deport the individuals concerned to the countries from which they come."" he said it was a route that was being pursued in collaboration with foreign secretary jack straw ""in a very positive way"". mr clarke said that he was seeking ""memorandums of understanding"" between overseas governments and britain to ensure suspects would not be subjected to the death penalty on their return. however, he added: ""i do not think the solution to the law lords' judgement for this government is in deportations, but they will help. ""there are other strands that we have to do."" but the liberal democrat's shadow home secretary, mark oaten, accused mr clarke of avoiding the main issue with the belmarsh detainees.

""the critical issue that the home secretary is dodging at this stage is to deal with the very principle, to deal with how we tackle this problem in the future,"" he told bbc news. ""and i do want him to grasp those issues and that means looking at how we can actually secure convictions in this country allowing, for example, intercept communications, telephone tapping to be included,"" mr oaten said. ""deportation may tackle this initial problem but i want to see a wider debate urgently about how we can actually get trials and convictions in this country."" ""unless we get that, the liberal democrats will vote against this measure when it comes for renewal in march.""

the bbc's home affairs correspondent, daniel sandford, said it appeared mr clarke was putting more emphasis on the possibility of deportation than his predecessor, david blunkett. but he said reaching an understanding with some of the detainees' home countries could be difficult. ""some of these people are accused of very, very serious crimes in their home countries so it's not an easy agreement to get and i think for some of these suspects it won't be the solution."" daniel sandford said ministers may try to put forward other solutions - such as allowing more secret evidence to be put into normal criminal trials or developing a more secret trials process - in the next few weeks. ""the government may try and deport some of them and then those that are left see if they can work out some way of putting them on trial,"" he said.

116,"act on detention ruling, uk urged

the government must act quickly on the law lords' ruling that detention of foreign terror suspects without trial is unlawful, mary robinson has said.

the former un commissioner for human rights and irish president told radio 4's today the government's response would be scrutinised internationally. ""it would be very troubling if the government did not accept the judgement and then work within it,"" she said. home secretary charles clarke has said detainees will not be freed at present. speaking to parliament on his first day in office as home secretary following david blunkett's resignation, mr clarke said: ""i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year. ""in the meantime, we will be studying the judgement carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords.""

mrs robinson said the law lords' ruling was ""in line with international legal opinion"" and praised their ""very decisive"" eight to one majority. ""what the law lords did was acknowledge the role of the government, but say that there had been a disproportionate use, that it amounted to executive detention and it was discriminatory because it didn't apply to british citizens,"" she said.

mrs robinson warned that a lack of action by the british government could lead to further action in legal arenas such as the european court of human rights in strasbourg. ""if the government were not to accept this ruling then there is further redress, including possible damages for the individuals who could claim that the government either was tardy or was resisting the implications of the judgement of the law lords."" she said a meeting of the club of madrid - a group of former world leaders - to be held in the spanish capital on the march anniversary of the train bombings there would probably discuss the ruling and its implications. ""i have no doubt that this judgement will be looked at, both as a very positive step in clarifying the law and restating the fundamental principles, but also the response of the british government will be under quite a clear international scrutiny there.""

the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us. any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. the law lords said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions ""in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status"". the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case.

93,"conservative backing for id cards

the tories are to back controversial government plans to introduce id cards.

the shadow cabinet revealed its support ahead of next week's commons vote on a bill to introduce compulsory id. the decision follows a ""tough meeting"" where some senior tories argued vociferously against the move, party sources told the bbc. the bill, which ministers claim will tackle crime, terrorism and illegal immigration, is expected to be opposed by the liberal democrats.

they have said the scheme is ""deeply flawed"" and a waste of money. sources within the conservative party told the bbc michael howard has always been in favour of id cards, and tried to introduce them when he was home secretary. the party has been ""agnostic"" on the issue until now but had now decided to come off the fence, the tory source said. despite giving their backing to id cards, the conservatives insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.

they said they would also press labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the home office would deliver them. and they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of id cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. ""it is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,"" a spokesman said. ""it will do nothing to solve the immediate problems of rising crime and uncontrolled immigration.""

lib dem home affairs spokesman mark oaten said: ""this has all the signs of michael howard overruling colleagues' concerns over id cards. ""the tories should have the courage to try and change public opinion not follow it."" the new chairman of the bar council, guy mansfield qc warned there was a real risk that people on the ""margins of society"" would be driven into the hands of extremists.

1217,"file-swappers ready new network

legal attacks on websites that help people swap pirated films have forced the development of a system that could be harder to shut down.

one site behind the success of the bittorrent file-swapping system is producing its own software that avoids the pitfalls of the earlier program. a test version of the new exeem program will be released in late january. but doubts remain about the new networks ability to ensure files being swapped are ""quality copies"".

in late december movie studios launched a legal campaign against websites that helped people swap pirated movies using the bittorrent network. the legal campaign worked because of the way that bittorrent is organised. that file-sharing system relies on links called ""trackers"" that point users to others happy to share the file they are looking for. shutting down sites that listed trackers crippled the bittorrent network. one of the sites shut down by the legal campaign was suprnova.org which helped boost the popularity of the bittorrent system by checking that trackers led to the movies or tv programmes they claimed to.

now the man behind suprnova.org, who goes by the nickname sloncek, is preparing to release software for a new file-swapping network dubbed exeem. in an interview with novastream web radio, sloncek said exeem would combine ideas from the bittorrent and kazaa file-sharing systems. like bittorrent, exeem will have trackers that help point people toward the file they want. like kazaa these trackers will be held by everyone. there will be no centrally maintained list. this, said sloncek, should make the system less vulnerable to legal action aimed at stopping people swapping pirated movies and music. the exeem software has been under development for a few months and is currently being tested by a closed group of users. an early public version of the software should be available before february. sloncek said that currently only a windows version of the software was in development. there were no plans for a linux or mac version. he said that costs of writing the software will be paid for by adverts appearing in the finished version of the program. despite suprnova administrator sloncek's involvement with exeem, the basic technology appears to have been developed by a firm called swarm systems that is based on caribbean island saint kitts and nevis.

users of the exeem system will be able to rate files being swapped to help stop the spread of fake files, sloncek told novastream.

dr johan pouwelse, a researcher at the delft university of technology who studies peer-to-peer networks, said exeem was the next evolution in file-sharing systems. but, he said, it would struggle to be as popular as bittorrent and suprnova because early versions were not taking enough care to make sure good copies of files were being shared. ""exeem cannot prevent pollution,"" he said. ""the rating system in exeem seems flawed because it is easy to insert both fake files and fake ratings,"" he said. studies have shown that organisations working for record labels and movie studios have worked to undermine kazaa by putting in fakes. by contrast moderators on suprnova made sure files being shared were high quality. ""the moderators are the difference between having a system that works and one that's full of crap like kazaa,"" he said. ""there is a fundamental tension between distribution and integrity,"" he said. mr pouwelse said that future versions of file-sharing systems are likely to incorporate some kind of distributed reputation system that lets moderators prove who they are to the network and rate which files are worth downloading. when big files were being shared moderation systems were key, said mr pouwelse. he added that the legal attacks on bittorrent had driven people away from sites such as suprnova but many users had simply migrated to other tracker listing sites many of which have seen huge increases in traffic. ""it's hard to compete with free,"" he said. no-one from the motion picture association of america was immediately available for comment on the file-sharing development.

2057,"brazil approves bankruptcy reform

a major reform of brazil's bankruptcy laws has been approved by the country's congress, in a move which it is hoped will cut the cost of borrowing.

the bill, proposed in 1993, has finally been approved by the leadership of president luiz inacio lula da silva. the old law, dating from 1945, gave priority first to workers, second to tax revenue and finally to creditors. the new legislation changes this, giving priority to creditors and limiting payments to workers. the new regulations will limit payments to workers to 150 times the minimum monthly salary, which is currently $94. the law also makes it more difficult for a company to declare bankruptcy. however, when a firm is declared bankrupt it will gain protection from creditors for 180 days while a recovery plan is worked out.

the proposals were opposed in the past by leftist parties, including mr lula's worker party. they considered that they undermined workers' rights. but president lula became a defender of the reforms, arguing that the country's bank lending margins were among the highest in the world and were damaging the economy. according to andreas adriano of latin trade magazine, the new bankruptcy law will help in reducing the spread - difference between the interest rates of the banks and federal bonds. nevertheless, mr adriano said to reduce the basic interest rate the central bank needs to change its policy, focusing not only on inflation but also on economic growth.

7,"chancellor rallies labour voters

gordon brown has issued a rallying cry, telling supporters the ""stakes are too high"" to stay at home or protest vote in the forthcoming general election.

the chancellor said the vote - expected to fall on 5 may - will give a ""clear and fundamental"" choice between labour investment and conservative cuts. speaking at labour's spring conference in gateshead, mr brown claimed the nhs was not safe in conservative hands. he said tory plans to cut â£35bn tax would ""cut deep into public service"".

to a packed audience at gateshead's sage centre, the chancellor said the cuts proposed by shadow chancellor oliver letwin were the equivalent of sacking every teacher, gp and nurse in the country, he told activists. laying into the conservative's record in government he said: ""i give you this promise - with labour, britain will never return to the mistakes of erm and 10% inflation, 15% interest rates, â£3bn in lost reserves, 250,000 repossessed, one million in negative equity and three million unemployed. ""never again tory boom and bust.

""this will be the central dividing line at the election, between a conservative party taking britain back and planning deep cuts of â£35bn in our services, and a labour government taking britain forward, which on a platform of stability will reform and renew our hospitals, schools and public services and, i am proud to say, spend by 2008 â£60bn more."" turning to the economy, the chancellor pledged to continue economic stability and growth in a third term in power.

he said after seven years labour had transformed from a party not trusted with the economy to ""the only party trusted with the economy"". it was now a ""party not just of employees, but of employers and managers"", he said. in the speech - which prompted a standing ovation from an audience clearly ""warm"" to mr brown - he also promised to end teenage unemployment within the next five years. he also highlighted plans for 100% debt relief for the world's poorest countries, a national minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds and the creation of a network of children's centres and flexibility in maternity leave. the prime minister is to take part later on saturday in an interactive question and answer session, fielding queries sent in by e-mail, text message and telephone as part of labour's attempt to engage the public in their campaign.

the us stock market regulator is investigating troubled insurance broker marsh & mclennan's shareholder transactions, the firm has said.

the securities and exchange commission has asked for information about transactions involving holders of 5% or more of the firm's shares. marsh has said it is co-operating fully with the sec investigation. marsh is also the focus of an inquiry the new york attorney-general into whether insurers rigged the market. since that inquiry was launched in october, marsh has replaced its chief executive and held a boardroom shake-out to meet criticism by lessening the number of company executives on the board. prosecutors allege that marsh - the world's biggest insurance broker - and other us insurance firms may have fixed bids for corporate cover. this is the issue at the heart of the inquiry by new york's top law officer, eliot spitzer, and a separate prosecution of five insurers by the state of california. the sec's investigation into so-called related party transactions includes dealings in the trident funds, managed by mmc capital, the company's private equity firm. marsh's new chief executive, michael cherkasky, is trying to negotiate a settlement with mr spitzer. mr spitzer has built up a reputation as a fierce critic and campaigner against corporate america's misdeeds.

the uncertainty unleashed by the scandal has prompted three credit rating agencies - standard & poor's, moody's and fitch - to downgrade marsh in recent weeks. according to the financial times, insurance analysts are now questioning whether marsh will be able to maintain its strong record of earning growth as they draw up forecasts for the first quarter of next year. doubts also exist over how much the company may have to pay regulators and lawyers to put the scandal behind.

he told the newspaper: ""if an admission is made, it is a totally different ball game... it could be used as evidence. ""the options are: if there is enough evidence they will be charged. if not they will be released as soon as possible."" the men have been allowed to meet their lawyers. louise christian said that after being ""tortured and abused"" at guantanamo bay, the men's arrest was unfair and inappropriate. she told bbc news she remained very concerned about their psychological state. gareth peirce, lawyer for mr begg, said she was shocked at the condition of the men and appalled that the authorities felt the need to detain them. washington has claimed all four were ""enemy combatants"" who trained at camps run by al-qaeda. the pentagon says they were freed after the uk government promised they would not be a threat to the national security of the us or any of its allies.

the detainees were immediately arrested under section 41 of the terrorism act 2000 when they landed at raf northolt, west london, on tuesday. massoud shadjareh, from the muslim safety forum, said: ""what sort of homecoming is this? they are innocent people."" the muslim council of britain urged that the men should receive counselling and medical help.

1509,"no jail for singer courtney love

singer courtney love has been spared jail for assault and drug offences, but must serve three years probation.

she had back-to-back court appearances in two separate cases in los angeles, first pleading no contest to attacking a woman with a whisky bottle. in the second, ms love, 40, pleaded guilty to possessing a forged prescription and painkiller oxycodone. she must also do 100 hours community service, have drug treatment, attend narcotics anonymous and pay a fine. the ex-hole singer's lawyer howard weitzman said ms love had ""turned her life around"" and she was ""clean and sober"".

the assault charge stemmed from april 2004, when ms love found musician kristin king in her boyfriend's home. ms king said the singer ""threw the bottle at the left side of my face"" in an ""angry, vicious and erratic"" attack. ms love was originally charged with the more serious offence of assault with a deadly weapon, but that was reduced to assault. judge rand rubin said she must:

- spend three years on probation 
 - have one year's anger management counselling 
 - have one year's drug rehabilitation 
 - do 100 hours community service 
 - pay $1,000 (â£535) fine 
 - have random drug tests

801,"a year to remember for irish

there used to be one subliminal moment during a year in irish rugby that stood out more than most.

well, at least there used to one. now there is a handful to look back with a mixture of satisfaction, and sorrow. it has been quite a year for the irish, and not just with eddie o'sullivan's triple crown winning international outfit either. right down through the ranks irish rugby is creating waves and upsetting the more established teams in the game. but most of the kudos will go to o'sullivan and his merry band of warriors who not only collected their first triple crown for 29 years, but also finished their autumn campaign with a 100% record. for the second year in succession they also finished in the runners-up spot in the rbs six nations. but in the three games in november which included a victory over tri-nations champions and grand slam chasing south africa, ireland finsihed the year on a high. the 18-12 victory at lansdowne road was only their second victory over the boks after the initial success back in 1965. that success was revenge for the consecutive defeats in blomefontein and cape town in the summer. those two reverses and the 35-17 flop against france, were the only dark patches in an otherwise excellent 12 months. but the big one, of course, was the 19-13 defeat of world cup champions england on their precious twickenham turf. the winning try was conceived in o'sullivan's mind, perfectly executed by the team and finished immaculately by girvan dempsey. for me, the try of the championship. o'sullivan's career is now in vertical take-off mode. it is no wonder that sir clive woodward has elevated the galway-based coach to head the lions test side. not only that, but a fair majority of the present ireland side will be wearing red next june in new zealand.

there can be no doubt that ireland's representation will be the biggest ever, albeit in a proposed 44-man squad. in brian o'driscoll and paul o'connell, ireland have now the two front-runners for the captaincy. gordon d'arcy, whose career began as a teenager back in 1999, finally arrived when he was named the six nations player of the tournament. but it was not only the senior squad that brought kudos to ireland, the youngsters strutted their stuff on the big stage as well. the under-21 squad confounded the doubters as they went all the way to the world cup final in scotland only to be beaten by a powerful all black side in the decider. the young irish boys had stated their intentions earlier in the season when they finished runners-up to england in the six nations under-21 tournament. on the provincial front, leinster, for second year in succession, blew it when the heineken cup looked a good wager. while ulster finished runners-up in their very tight group for the second season in succession, it was munster again flying the flag for the irish. looking to reach their third final, they went down 37-32 to eventual winners wasps in what many beileve was the most competitive and thunderous game ever witnessed at lansdowne road. how wasps recovered from that energy-sapping duel, and then go onto to defeat toulouse in the final was anybody's guess. ulster, meanwhile, just lost out to adding the inaugural celtic cup in winning the celtic league when they were pipped at the post by the scarlets in the final game.

ulster, however, took time to start the new season under new coach mark mccall. the once famous ravenhill fortress was breached four times as ulster only manged five wins from their first 12 outings in the celtic league. leinster are again looking the most potent outfit going into 2005, but whether they can take that final step under declan kidney is another thing. on the down side, irish rugby was hit by a number of tragedies. teenage star john mccall died while playing for the ireland against new zealand in the under-19 world cup game in durban. that happened only 10 days after he led royal armagh to their first ulster schools' cup success since 1977. the death of former ireland coach and lions flanker mike doyle in a car crash in northern ireland shocked the rugby fraternity a larger than life character, doyle had coached ireland to the triple crown in 1985, the last time that goal had been achieved before this season. ulster rugby also suffered the sudden deaths of well-known londonderry ym player jim huey, coleraine's jonathan hutchinson, and belfast harlequins lock johnny poole. they all passed away long before the full-time whistle.

1435,"music man to the oscars

bill conti's job of musical director of the oscars show is not for the faint-hearted since conducting the orchestra is the ultimate plate-spinning assignment.

this year marks conti's 17th turn at the helm of the academy awards orchestra. ""the excitement is a live performance as a musician,"" he says. ""all of your colleagues, everyone in the film industry is in the theatre. all the important people. ""i guess it's just a television show but we always think it's a bit more.' the orchestra strikes up more than 110 times during the average oscars show. as well as playing the presenters and winners on and off stage, it also performs during the commercial breaks to entertain the live audience in the house.

""it's a very busy evening, it takes a certain amount of preparation of music, orchestrating, sketching rehearsing, before the show. but you don't know what the unexpected will be and as the musical director, it's exciting,"" explains conti. and much of the preparation goes into mastering scores that will never be performed. ""we don't know who the winners will be. so when they say, 'the winner is', we have five different pieces of music in front of us, they say the name, we play the appropriate one immediately,"" adds conti.

the orchestra is often called upon to play when the winners ramble on too long during their acceptance speeches, despite being told to be brief by the show's producers.

the decision to drown out or 'kill' the offending star with music is relayed from the director's box to the orchestra via conti's earpiece. ""i don't feel good about it at all. it's not my call though,"" he says. ""when the director says 'music' the orchestra plays and he takes a long shot of the hall. we don't usually see the person speaking while his microphone is cut off. ""the person that's been cut off, who's 10 feet from me, is glaring at me like it's death time."" on occasions, some stars have taken it upon themselves to send a warning shot across the bows of the musical director before they start to speak. ""julia roberts, when she came on, she asked me to not get ready to play because she had so much to do,"" he says. conti received an oscar in 1983 for the original score of the right stuff. he also received two nominations in the original song category in 1976 for gonna fly now from rocky and in 1981 for the title song from for your eyes only.

""it's a moment in the sun,"" he says. ""when people get up there, some people, this is hard to believe, people that spend their lives in front of the camera or audiences entertaining, might get a little flustered. ""but there's this moment in time when the biggest award that they could possibly get in their life has been handed to them and they're either not in control or they want to thank everyone that they ever met.""

the image of the oscars telecast is one of slick presentation and smooth transitions between performances and the award categories. behind the scenes, the key players, such as conti, have a bewildering array of technical props to deal with. ""there's a big script and video monitors you have to watch and there are also audio controls. i can control hearing in my ears, the left ear or the right ear - different things at different times.

""i have to communicate with the director. i have a little microphone that's attached to my headset. to open up that microphone, i have a footswitch,"" he explains. conti's most nerve-wracking moment came during his first oscars show as musical director, in 1977, when a member of the orchestra alerted him that they could smell smoke. conti immediately told the show's director: ""i start cursing and screaming, i tell him we're not going to die for this show - you must do something or i'm going to climb out of this pit with 60 musicians and we're going to be home in 10 minutes. ""'oh no bill don't do anything,"" came the response. ""imagine these elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen of the orchestra, 60 or so of them in the pit and while we're playing, firemen with their helmets and their hatchets crawling among us trying to find the reason for the smoke."" the smell turned out to be new paint smouldering on the music stands. ""no one died, it's not a big story, but it was scary at the time,"" laughs conti. when the ceremony is over, the music director attends the annual governor's ball with his family. ""i have a drink and relive the show,"" he says. ""i'm not for too much carousing. i go home and unwind. it takes me about a day.""

695,"moody joins up with england

lewis moody has flown to dublin to join england's camp ahead of their rbs six nations game against ireland on sunday.

despite joining the squad, the leicester flanker only has a ""slim"" chance of playing because of an infection in his finger. a decision will be taken on saturday as to whether the 26-year-old will be declared fit. if he fails to recover in time for the game, his place at the back of the pack will be taken by andy hazell. chris jones will then start the game on the bench. ""the chances of him playing are very slim,"" said coach andy robinson. ""the infection is deeper than was thought.""

moody had to be put on a drip in an attempt to force antibiotics through his infected finger. he suffered the cut playing against france at twickenham and it became infected during a 10-minute outing as a replacement for leicester against newcastle last saturday. ""the mud got into it,"" robinson added. ""he has had a big course of antibiotics but they haven't done the job we hoped they would."" robinson has already been forced to make one change to the starting line-up with bath prop matt stevens coming in for the injured phil vickery.

the 22-year-old has only made 10 starts for his club but has made 49 appearances from the bench. ""it can be frustrating but i've had a lot more game time this season and i'm ready for it,"" stevens said. ""i've been on tour with these boys and i've been in the england set-up for two years so i know the calls and the way they play."" stevens will be winning his third cap on sunday after coming on twice as a replacement on the tour to new zealand last year.

robinson has confirmed that fly-half charlie hodgson will be the first-choice kicker despite his three missed penalties and a drop goal against france. ""charlie's state of mind is very good,"" said robinson. ""obviously, we are all disappointed we lost the french game and the circumstances in which we did. ""but he responded well last week in his goalkicking for sale and he will be our first-choice kicker this week.""

robinson also admits his side must improve their line-out work against irish duo malcolm o'kelly and paul o'connell, one of the most effective partnerships in the game. ""in each game we've missed a number of line-outs,"" he added. ""it cost us the game against wales but it has improved. ""it was better against france and will have to go up another notch against ireland. it will be a huge battle. ""look at the way they tore us apart last year. if it doesn't function, we will be in for a torrid time.""

1948,"g7 backs africa debt relief plan

g7 finance ministers have backed plans to write off up to 100% of the debts of some of the world's poorest countries.

uk chancellor gordon brown said the london meeting of the world's seven richest nations would be remembered as ""the 100% debt relief summit"". some 37 countries could benefit after a case-by-case review by bodies including the world bank and the imf, he said. but the us says it cannot support mr brown's international finance facility to boost aid to developing countries. bbc correspondents said the meeting had produced some movement towards the uk's ambitions, but much work was needed. mr brown said it was a major breakthrough for the international organisations to offer up to 100% multilateral debt relief - ""the vast bulk"" of money owed by the poorest countries.

""we could be at the beginning of the final stage of the process where the debts that were owed by the poorest countries, built up over 20 or 30 years, debts that are simply unpayable in the real world, are finally taken care of,"" he said. he added: ""it is the richest countries hearing the voices of the poor."" but he said they would insist on government reforms and the need for transparency, tackling corruption and openness from both the poorest and richest nations. bbc correspondent patrick bartlett said while it was an agreement in principle, the organisations involved now have to look at how it would work in practice. oxfam senior policy adviser max lawson welcomed the statement and said g7 ministers had ""passed the first hurdle of 2005"".

but he added: ""they need to move quickly to turn their proposals into real change for the world's poorest. ""two million children will die needlessly between now and the next meeting in april. if rich countries are going to keep their promises to tackle obscene poverty they need deliver - and deliver quickly."" talks are continuing on how to finance increased overseas development assistance. the international monetary fund (imf) is to look at a proposal to use its gold supplies to help the debt relief effort when it meets in april. mr brown said g7 ministers had agreed to defer debt interest payments and repayments for some countries affected by the tsunami until the end of 2005. but uk plans for an international finance facility (iff) to help deal with debt in the developing world have not been agreed. mr brown wanted to provide $10bn (â£5.38bn) a year over a decade, using g7 backing so the money could be borrowed up front on financial markets.

it is a key element of his proposals for a modern version of the marshall plan, which brought us aid to rebuild europe after world war ii, for the developing world. mr brown said it was ""winning support every day"" and said a programme had been agreed to draw up more details in time for the g8 summit in july. but us treasury under-secretary john taylor said the us could not support the iff because of its ""legislative process"". ""the us is completely committed to poverty reduction and providing financing to do that,"" he said. ""but this particular mechanism does not work for the united states. it works for other countries, and that is fine."" earlier, he told bbc radio 4's today programme the us had increased support for africa in the past four years from $1.1bn per year to $4.6bn per year. but south africa finance minister trevor manuel told the bbc's talking point programme what was needed was one approach, with all wealthy nations on board. he said much of the money pledged by the us had not yet been dispensed.

the uk has made poverty in the poorest nations a key theme for its 2005 presidency of the group of eight (g8), which comprises the g7 and russia. the g8 countries will meet at gleneagles in scotland. at a dinner on friday night, former south african president nelson mandela backed mr brown's plan when he urged the finance chiefs to write-off african debt and provide an extra $50bn (â£26.69bn) a year in aid for the next decade. talks also centred on the impact of the rising economies of china and india, the us budget and trade deficits, how the us, europe and japan can act to boost global economic growth, and hiv/aids. g7 ministers called for more flexibility in international exchange rates and said ""excess volatility"" would impede economic growth. representatives from china, india, russia, south africa and brazil were invited to attend some of the sessions. a g8 summit is set to take place in july.

1937,"us interest rate rise expected

us interest rates are expected to rise for the fifth time since june following the us federal reserve's latest rate-setting meeting later on tuesday.

borrowing costs are tipped to rise by a quarter of a percentage point to 2.25%. the move comes as a recovery in the us economy, the world's biggest, shows signs of robustness and sustainability. the dollar's record-breaking decline, meanwhile, has spooked markets and along with high oil prices has raised concerns about the pace of inflation. ""we are seeing evidence that inflation is moving higher,"" said ken kim, an analyst at stone & mccarthy research. ""it's not a risk, it's actually happening."" mr kim added that borrowing costs could rise further.

the fed has said that it will move in a ""measured"" way to combat price growth and lift interest rates from their 40-year lows that were prompted by sluggish us and global growth.

with the economic picture now looking more rosy, the fed has implemented quarter percentage point rises in june, august, september and november. although the us economy grew at an annual rate of 3.9% in the three months to september, analysts warn that fed has to be careful not to move too aggressively and take the wind out of the recovery's sails. earlier this month figures showed that job creation is still weak, while consumer confidence is subdued. ""i think the fed feels it has a fair amount of flexibility,"" said david berson, chief economist at fannie mae. ""while inflation has moved up, it hasn't moved up a lot.""

82,"howard unveils election platform

the conservatives would stand up for the ""forgotten majority"", michael howard pledged as he unveiled the first part of the tory election manifesto.

the tory leader argued there was a mass of people whom he says feel let down by tony blair and who share tory values. in the foreword to the manifesto, he promises to focus on restoring order, trying to lower taxes and giving power back to the people. labour says the document offers only a return to a ""failed tory past"". the liberal democrats say the conservatives cannot win what they predict will be a three-party contest.

campaigning activity is accelerating ahead of the general election, which is widely tipped for may but could be any time before june 2006. labour on monday postponed a launch of election posters because of the asian tsunami disaster. mr howard published the introduction to the tory manifesto. other chapters will follow in coming weeks.

in a speech in northamptonshire, he said the ""forgotten majority"" made up the backbone of britain. they were people who were saving for their first home or their retirement, working hard and accepting their responsibilities. he says in the manifesto foreword: ""they have been forgotten, neglected and taken for granted by mr blair.""

1047,"viewers to be able to shape tv

imagine editing titanic down to watch just your favourite bits or cutting out the slushier moments of star wars to leave you with a bare bones action-fest.

manipulating your favourite films to make a more personalised movie is just the beginning of an ambitious new 7.5m euro (â£5.1m) project funded by the european union. new media for a new millennium (nm2) will have as its endgame the development of a completely new media genre, which will allow audiences to create their own media worlds based on their specific interests or tastes. viewers will be able to participate in storylines, manipulate plots and even the sets and props of tv shows. bt is one of 13 partners involved in the project. it will be contributing software that was originally designed to spot anomalies in cctv pictures. the software uses content recognition algorithms. the three-year project will work on seven productions as it develops a set of software tools that will allow viewers to edit content to their needs.

one of the productions will be a experimental television show where the plot will be driven by text messages from the tv audience.

participants will text selected words which will impact how the characters in the drama interact. it is being developed in finland and will be shown to finnish tv audiences. another team will work on the bbc's big budget drama of mervyn peake's gothic fantasy gormenghast. it will be re-engineered to allow people to choose a variety of edited versions. ""the bbc is allowing us access to the material so that we can prove the technology and the principles,"" explained dr doug williams of bt, who will be nm2's technical project manager. ""the tv at the moment is a relatively dumb box which receives signals. this project is about teaching the machine to look at content like lego blocks that can be reassembled to make perfect sense,"" he said. ""at the moment we have interactive gaming and a limited form of interactive tv which usually means allowing audiences to vote on shows. we are hoping to occupy the space in-between,"" he added.

nm2's co-ordinator peter stollenmayer explained that the new genre would radically alter the role of the audience.

""viewers will be able to interact directly with the medium and influence what they see and hear according to their personal tastes and wishes,"" he said. ""media users will no longer be passive viewers but become active engagers."" it will also be important that the tools are sophisticated enough to obey the complex rules of cinematography and editing said john wyver, from tv producer illuminations television limited, which is also involved in the project. ""it's not just a matter of stringing together the romantic or action portions of a production,"" said mr wyver. ""the tool has to know which bits fit together both visually, by observing the time-honoured rules that go in editing, and in terms of the story."" ""only then will the personalised version both make sense and be aesthetically pleasing,"" he added. mr wyver is planning a production entitled the golden age, about renaissance art. it will allow viewers to create a so-called media world based on their own specific areas of interest such as poetry, music and architecture. other productions that the nm2 team will make range from news, documentaries to a romantic comedy drama.

1767,"uk house prices dip in november

uk house prices dipped slightly in november, the office of the deputy prime minister (odpm) has said.

the average house price fell marginally to â£180,226, from â£180,444 in october. recent evidence has suggested that the uk housing market is slowing after interest rate increases, and economists forecast a drop in prices during 2005. but while the monthly figures may hint at a cooling of the market, annual house price inflation is still strong, up 13.8% in the year to november. economists, however, forecast that odpm figures are likely to show a weakening in annual house price growth in coming months. ""overall, the housing market activity is slowing down and that is backed up by the mortgage lending and the mortgage approvals data,"" said mark miller, at hbos treasury services. ""the odpm data is a fairly lagging indicator.""

the figures come after the bank of england said the number of mortgages approved in the uk has fallen to the lowest level for nearly a decade. the halifax, meanwhile, said last week that house prices increased by 1.1% in december - the first monthly rise since september.

the uk's biggest mortgage lender said prices rose 15.1% over the whole of 2004, but by only 2.8% in the second half of the year. it is predicting a 2% fall in overall prices in 2005 as the market stabilises after large gains in recent years. the odpm attributed the monthly fall of prices in november to a drop in the value of detached houses and flats. it said annual inflation rose between october and november because prices had fallen by 1.1% in the same period in 2003.

the odpm data showed the average house price was â£192,713 in england; â£139,544 in wales; â£116,542 in scotland, and â£111,314 in northern ireland.

all areas saw a rise in annual house price inflation in november except for northern ireland and the west midlands, where the rate was unchanged, the odpm said. the north east showed the highest rate of inflation at 26.2%, followed by yorkshire and the humber on 21.7%, and the north west on 21.1%. the east midlands, the west midlands and the south west all had an annual inflation rate of more than 15%. in london, the area with the highest average house price at â£262,825, annual inflation rose only slightly in november to 7.1% from 7% the previous month.

1650,"oscars steer clear of controversy

the oscars nominations list has left out some of the most controversial films of the past year in favour of safer, less contentious cinema.

if best film nominees were drawn on the basis of column inches, two of the front-runners would have had to be michael moore's bush-baiting documentary fahrenheit 9/11 and mel gibson's the passion of the christ. both films polarised opinion but had critics talking, and the public turning up to see them - fahrenheit 9/11 breaking us box office records for a documentary, and the passion of the christ making more than us$370m (â£196m) in the us alone. but this year's academy awards have shied away from the big name controversies, with the passion of the christ - a film accused of being anti-semitic - receiving nominations only in the 'minor' categories of cinematography, makeup and musical score.

fahrenheit 9/11 has also been overlooked, despite winning the palme d'or at the cannes international film festival in 2004.

moore's caustic documentary may have been affected by its distributors' decision to enter it in the best picture category, rather than best documentary, says tim dams, the news editor of trade magazine screen international. but he also believes the strong political viewpoint of moore's film does not sit well with the academy. ""if you look at past oscar winners and nominees, the very conservative oscar voters tend to go for very conservative, epic-style pictures. fahrenheit 9/11 didn't really fit in to that category. ""they tend to go for films like titanic, gladiator, and the lord of the rings, films with scale that often aren't too contentious,"" he said. while he said the oscar voting panel were not ""snubbing"" moore's film, he thought it was unlikely a documentary could ever seriously compete in a best film category. ""i think it's more a misjudgement by the people putting it out rather than a deliberate snub,"" he said.

the problem with mel gibson's film, he believed, was that the voting panel may have been cautious in nominating a film with dialogue in aramaic, an ancient middle eastern language.

""hollywood doesn't tend to like foreign-language films - no-one's ever tried doing a film in a dead language,"" he said. but aside from these two films, some potentially contentious pictures have won nominations. the german film the downfall, a biopic tracing the final days of nazi leader adolf hitler in his berlin bunker, has been recognised in the best foreign film category. the film has caused some controversy in showing hitler as a fallible but human man, rather than a semi-mythical, historical monster. but mr dams said: ""it's not an inflammatory film. it has done very well in germany, and it's a film that portrays hitler as a human rather than some kind of devil or monster."" another 'contentious' film, mr dams said, has gained a nomination in the best documentary section through the force of its charm.

independent film-maker morgan spurlock may have forced fast-food giant mcdonalds to withdraw its 'super size' portions in the us after he went on a month-long diet eating nothing but mcdonalds meals - and filmed his progress.

the film has been a hit around the world. mr dams said: ""it's a political film, but it's quite fun and punky and well-paced. ""morgan spurlock is a really likeable guy. it's a very accessible film, and it doesn't beat you over the head with its views. ""while in fahrenheit 9/11 there are moments of comedy, i think the way that super size me is put together - the fact it's a very likeable film - means it's won through on charm."" dam's pick at this year's oscars? the aviator, martin scorsese's biopic of aviation pioneer and hollywood player howard hughes. tinseltown, it seems, likes nothing more than a picture about one of its own.

1087,"gangsters dominate gaming chart

video games on consoles and computers proved more popular than ever in 2004.

gamers spent more than â£1.34bn in 2004, almost 7% more than they did in 2003 according to figures released by the uk gaming industry's trade body. sales records were smashed by the top title of the year gta: san andreas - in which players got the job of turning central character cj into a crime boss. the game sold more than 1 million copies in the first nine days that it was on sale. this feat made it the fastest selling video game of all time in the uk. although only released in november the sprawling story of guns, gangsters game beat off strong competition and by year end had sold more than 1.75 million copies. there were also records set for the number of games that achieved double-platinum status by selling more than 600,000 copies. five titles, including sony eyetoy play and ea's need for speed: underground 2, managed this feat according to figures compiled by chart-track for the entertainment and leisure software publishers association (elspa). electronic arts, the world's biggest games publisher, had 9 games in the top 20.

2004 was a ""stellar year"" said roger bennett, director general of elspa. ""in a year with no new generation consoles being released, the market continued to be buoyant as the industry matured and the increasingly diverse range of games reached new audiences and broadened its player base - across ages and gender,"" he said. part of the success of games in 2004 could be due to the fact that so many of them are sequels. 16 out of the top 20 titles were all follow-ups to established franchises or direct sequels to previously popular games. halo, the sims, driver, need for speed, fifa football, burnout were just a few that proved as popular as the original titles. despite this fondness for older games, doom 3 did not make it to the top 20. movie tie-ins also proved their worth in 2004. games linked to shrek, the incredibles, spider-man, harry potter and lord of the rings were all in the top 20. elspa noted that sales of xbox games rose 37.9% during the year. however, sony's playstation 2 was the top seller with 47% of the â£1.34bn spent on games in 2004 used to buy titles for that console. despite winning awards and rave reviews half-life 2 did not appear in the list. this was because it was only released on pc and, compared to console titles, sold in relatively small numbers. also the novel distribution system adopted by developer valve meant that many players downloaded the title rather than travel to the shops to buy a copy. valve has yet to release figures which show how many copies of the game were sold in this way.

1071,"tough rules for ringtone sellers

firms that flout rules on how ringtones and other mobile extras are sold could be cut off from all uk phone networks.

the rules allow offenders to be cut off if they do not let consumers know exactly what they get for their money and how to turn off the services. the first month under the new rules has seen at least ten firms suspended while they clean up the way they work. the rules have been brought in to ensure that the problems plaguing net users do not spread to mobile phones.

in the last couple of years ringtones, wallpapers, screensavers and lots of other extras for phones have become hugely popular. but fierce competition is making it difficult for firms to get their wares in front of consumers, said jeremy flynn, head of third party services at vodafone.

""if you are not on the operator's portal you are going to have quite heavy marketing costs because it's a problem of how people discover your services,"" he said. to combat this many ringtone and other mobile content sellers started using a new tactic to squeeze more cash out of customers. this tactic involved signing people up for a subscription to give them, for instance, several ringtones per week or month instead of the single track they thought they were getting. mr flynn said that the move to using subscriptions happened over the space of a few weeks at the end of 2004. websites such as grumbletext.co.uk started getting reports from customers who were racking up large bills for phone content they did not know they had signed up for. ""what made us uncomfortable was that these services were not being marketed transparently,"" said mr flynn. ""people did not know they were being offered a subscription service."" ""we saw potential for substantial consumer harm here,"" he added.

the swift adoption of subscription services led to the creation of a new code of conduct for firms that want to sell content for mobile phones. the drafting of the new rules was led by the mobile entertainment forum and the uk's phone firms. ""everyone is required to conform to this code of conduct,"" said andrew bud, regulatory head of the mef and executive chairman of messaging firm mblox.

""it's all about transparency,"" he said. ""consumers have to be told what they have got themselves into and how to get out of it."" ""the consumer has a right to be protected,"" he said. christian harris, partnership manager of mobile content firm zed, said the new system was essential if consumers were to trust companies that sell ringtones and other downloads. ""the groundrules must be applied across the whole industry and if that's done effectively we will see the cowboys driven out,"" he said. the new rules came in to force on 15 january and the first month under the new regime has seen many firms cautioned for not honouring them. some have been told to revamp websites so customers know what they get for their money and what they are signing up for, said mr flynn. also, said mr flynn, vodafone has briefly cut off between eight and ten content sellers flouting the rules. ""we have quite draconian contracts with firms,"" he said. ""we do not have to say why. we can just cut them off."" under the rules consumers must be able to switch off the services by using a universal ""stop"" command sent via text message. he said the system had been designed to limit how much a consumer will pay if they inadvertently signed up for a service. ""the mobile is so personal that people really resent the abuse of what is effectively part of their personality,"" said mr flynn.

if the result remains at 1-1, real will drop to third place in the standings, 11 points behind leaders barcelona, who snatched a late 2-1 win at albacete on saturday. initial reports suggested the basque separatist group eta may be responsible for the bomb threat after issuing similar warnings before a series of small explosions in recent days. the bernabeu was targeted by eta on 1 may, 2002, when madrid were about to play fc barcelona in a champions league semi-final. a car bomb exploded in a street outside the stadium and 17 people were slightly injured.

tony blair has apologised to two families who suffered one of the uk's biggest miscarriages of justice.

the prime minister was commenting on the wrongful jailing of 11 people for ira bomb attacks on pubs in guildford and woolwich in 1974. mr blair said: ""i am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice."" he made the apology to members of the conlon and maguire families in his private room at westminster. in a statement recorded for television, mr blair said the families deserved ""to be completely and publicly exonerated"".

the families had hoped the apology would be made during prime minister's questions in the house of commons. however, one of the so-called guildford four, gerry conlon - who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs - said the families were delighted with the apology. he said mr blair had spoken with ""such sincerity"", adding: ""he went beyond what we thought he would, he took time to listen to everyone. ""you could see he was moved by what people were saying. ""tony blair has healed rifts, he is helping to heal wounds. it's a day i never thought would come."" the move followed a huge campaign in ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the ira bombs which killed seven people. mr blair's official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would ""ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister's statement brought to them"".

most of those convicted were either members or friends of the two families. all were arrested because of a family connection to gerry conlon. mr conlon's father giuseppe was arrested when travelling to london from belfast to help his son. he died while serving his sentence. also arrested were anne maguire and members of her family. mrs maguire was the relative with whom giuseppe planned to stay in london, as well as two family friends. she said it was a ""wonderful feeling"" to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.

""the people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent,"" she said. they were all jailed for handling explosives, based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited. in october 1989 the court of appeal quashed the sentences of the guildford four, and in june 1991 it overturned the sentences on the maguire seven. mr conlon's case was highlighted in the oscar-nominated film in the name of the father, starring daniel day-lewis.

2145,"us interest rates increased to 2%

us interest rates are to rise for the fourth time in five months, in a widely anticipated move.

the federal reserve has raised its key federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 2% in light of mounting evidence that the us economy is regaining steam. us companies created twice as many jobs as expected in october while exports hit record levels in september. analysts said a clear-cut victory for president bush in last week's election paved the way for a rise. another rise could be in store for december, some economists warned.

the fed's open market committee - which sets interest rate policy in the us - voted unanimously in favour of a quarter point rise. the fed has been gradually easing rates up since the summer, with quarter percentage point rises in june, august and september.

the central bank has been acting to restrain inflationary pressures while being careful not to obstruct economic growth. the fed did not rule out raising rates once again in december but noted that any future increases would take place at a ""measured"" pace. in a statement, the fed said that long-term inflation pressures remained ""well contained"" while the us economy appeared to be ""growing at a moderate pace despite the rise in energy prices"". financial analysts broadly welcomed the fed's move and shares traded largely flat. the dow jones industrial average closed down 0.89 points, or 0.01%, at 10,385.48.

recent evidence has pointed to an upturn in the us economy. us firms created 337,000 jobs last month, twice the amount expected, while exports reached record levels in september. the economy grew 3.7% in the third quarter, slower than forecast, but an improvement on the 3.3% growth seen in the second quarter. analysts claimed the fed's assessment of future economic growth was a positive one but stressed that the jury was still out on the prospect of a further rise in december.

""let's wait until we see how growth and employment bear up under the fourth quarter's energy price drag before concluding that the fed has more work to do in 2005,"" said avery shenfeld, senior economist at cibc world markets.

""i think the federal reserve does not want to rock the boat and is using a gradual approach in raising the interest rate,"" said sung won sohn, chief us economist for wells fargo bank. ""the economy is doing a bit better right now but there are still some concerns about geopolitics, employment and the price of oil,"" he added. the further rise in us rates is unlikely to have a direct bearing on uk monetary policy. the bank of england (boe) has kept interest rates on hold at 4.75% for the past three months, leading some commentators to argue that rates may have peaked. in a report published on wednesday, the bank said that with rates at their current level, inflation would rise to its 2% target within two years. however, boe governor mervyn king warned only last month that the era of consistently low inflation and low unemployment may be coming to an end.

murdered director theo van gogh's controversial film submission has been pulled from the rotterdam film festival because of security fears.

it was one of three of his works to be shown as part of a freedom of expression event in tribute to the late film-maker's life. the film is critical of the treatment of women under islam. its tv screening is thought to have led to his murder. the 10-day dutch festival begins on wednesday. submission was made with liberal somali-dutch politician ayaan hirsi ali and was due to be shown on 30 january. van gogh was shot and stabbed to death in november 2004 several months after receiving death threats following submission's first broadcast on dutch television. two of van gogh's other films will be shown as planned, including the theatrical world premiere of his last feature 06/05.

festival director sandra den hamer said: ""the festival reflects what happens around us and within cinema itself."" the festival opens with the french film the 10th district court, moments of trials made by raymond depardon. the event sees 14 films competing to win three top tiger awards which aim to introduce promising new talent. new sections added to this year's festival include cinema of the future and cinema of the world, with special focus on russian and south-east asian productions. there is also an iraqi-german offering entitled underexposure, which looks at life in iraq after saddam hussein.

southampton's david prutton faces a possible seven-match ban when he goes before the football association.

the 23-year-old has admitted two charges of improper conduct following his dismissal against arsenal. the first charge relates to his failure to leave the field promptly, pushing referee alan wiley and remonstrating with assistant referee paul norman. and the second charge is for using threatening words and/or behaviour to a match official during the 1-1 draw.

paolo di canio was given a seven-match suspension when he pushed referee paul alcock over in a premiership game between sheffield wednesday and arsenal in 1998. prutton will be joined at wednesday's hearing by saints boss harry redknapp, who believes that the fa will throw the book at his player. redknapp himself sprinted along the touchline to help physio jim joyce and coach denis rofe shepherd the enraged prutton away from referee's assistant norman.

104,"goldsmith denies war advice claim

the attorney general has denied his statement to parliament about the legality of the iraq war was drafted by downing street officials.

lord goldsmith said lord falconer and baroness morgan played no part in drafting the answer. he added the answer represented his view that the war was legal, but was not a summary of his advice to the pm. the government has resisted calls to publish the full advice, saying such papers are always kept confidential.

in a statement, lord goldsmith said: ""i was fully involved throughout the drafting process and personally finalised, and of course approved, the answer."" he said the answer had been prepared in his office with the involvement of solicitor general harriet harman, two of his own officials, three foreign office officials, a qc, christopher greenwood and the then lord chancellor, lord irvine of lairg.

""no other minister or official was involved in any way."" he suggested the claim that lord falconer and lady morgan had drafted the answer were the result of a mis-transcription of his evidence to the butler inquiry into pre-war intelligence. ""as i have always made clear, i set out in the answer my own genuinely held, independent view that military action was lawful under the existing (un) security council resolutions,"" he said. ""the answer did not purport to be a summary of my confidential legal advice to government."" former foreign secretary robin cook said lord goldsmith's admission that his parliamentary answer was not a summary of his legal opinion suggested parliament may have been misled. ""the attorney general may never have presented his answer as a summary, but others certainly did,"" he said. ""what is clear from his statement today is that he does not believe that it was a full, accurate summary of his formal opinion.""

earlier, tony blair dismissed questions about the attorney general's advice, and said his parliamentary statement had been a ""fair summary"" of his opinion. ""that's what he (lord goldsmith) said and that's what i say. he has dealt with this time and time and time again,"" mr blair told his monthly news conference in downing street. he refused to answer further questions on the issue.

on the question of whether such papers have always been kept confidential, tory mp michael mates, who is a member of the commons intelligence and security committee and was part of the butler inquiry, told the bbc: ""that, as a general rule, is right, but it's not an absolute rule."" he said there had been other occasions when advice had been published, most recently regarding prince charles's marriage plans. the government could not pick and choose when to use the convention, he said. mr mates added: ""this may be one of those special occasions... when it would be in the public interest to see the advice which the attorney general gave to the prime minister.""

the claims about lord falconer and baroness morgan's involvement were made in a book published this week by philippe sands qc, a member of cherie blair's matrix chambers. he also says lord goldsmith warned tony blair on 7 march 2003 that the iraq war could be illegal without a second un resolution sanctioning military action.

a short statement about lord goldsmith's position presented in a written parliamentary answer on 17 march 2003 - just before a crucial commons vote on the military action - did not suggest this. former minister clare short, who resigned from the government over the iraq war, said the ministerial answer was the same statement that was earlier shown to the cabinet as it discussed military action. she said the full advice should have been attached, according to the ministerial code, and demanded a lords inquiry into the matter. the conservatives and liberal democrats say they still want the publication of the full legal advice given by the attorney general. lib dem foreign affairs spokesman sir menzies campbell said lord goldsmith's statement still did not clear up the outstanding issues. ""if his original advice of 7 march accepted that military action might be illegal, how was it that he resolved any such doubts by the time the parliamentary answer was published on 17 march?"" he said. ""only the fullest disclosure will now do.""

375,"kelly trails new discipline power

teachers could get more powers to remove unruly pupils from classes under a ""zero tolerance"" drive, education secretary ruth kelly has suggested.

ms kelly told the bbc progress had been made against severely disruptive children but parents were still worried about lower level problems. the minister also confirmed she received ""spiritual support"" from the catholic movement opus dei. but she denied her faith meant she would refuse key government jobs.

the conservatives have made school discipline one of their five priority areas in the run-up to the next general election. ms kelly is expected to announce her plans on the issue in the next fortnight. she told bbc one's breakfast with frost: ""it is really important to support head teachers and teachers in tackling disruption in the classroom. ""we have made huge progress on the really difficult cases, the pupils who have severely disruptive behaviour.

""but quite rightly what teachers are concerned about and what parents are concerned about is that this lower level disruption that goes on in the classroom now is tackled. ""i would like to see the teacher being able to remove disruptive children from the classroom completely and have either alternative provision within the school or indeed off the school and may be working together with other schools in a particular area to provide that provision."" it is thought the plans may distinguish between excluding pupils from schools and taking them out of mainstream classes. head teachers can currently exclude pupils who commit or threaten violence in school, who sexually abuse pupils or other people, who sell illegal drugs or who have persistent and malicious disruptive behaviour. ms kelly entered the cabinet last month in the reshuffle forced by the resignation of the then home secretary david blunkett. her links to opus dei, which means ""work of god"" in latin, have provoked controversy.

critics say the organisation, which adheres strictly to catholic teachings, is secretive and elitist but its members reject such claims. asked if she was a member of the group, ms kelly said: ""i do have spiritual support from opus dei and that is right. ""but those are private spiritual matters and i'm sure you'll respect that politicians are entitled to a private life."" she categorically denied reports that her beliefs on issues such as contraception would make her refuse to serve as a health or international development minister. her collective responsibility as a cabinet minister meant she also took responsibility for policies in those areas, she argued.

the government has yet to issue its official response to the tomlinson review, which recommended absorbing existing exam qualifications into a diploma. ms kelly said reforms should build on gcses and a-levels. her comments did not impress tory shadow education secretary tim collins. ""ruth kelly wants to ditch the tomlinson report on exam structures but has absolutely no idea what to put in its place,"" he said. ""she also talks of improving discipline but cannot make her mind up how. this is an all talk agenda that lets down children, teachers and parents.""

1021,"speech takes on search engines

a scottish firm is looking to attract web surfers with a search engine that reads out results.

called speegle, it has the look and feel of a normal search engine, with the added feature of being able to read out the results. scottish speech technology firm cec systems launched the site in november. but experts have questioned whether talking search engines are of any real benefit to people with visual impairments.

the edinburgh-based firm cec has married speech technology with ever-popular internet search. the ability to search is becoming increasingly crucial to surfers baffled by the huge amount of information available on the web.

according to search engine ask jeeves, around 80% of surfers visit search engines as their first port of call on the net. people visiting speegle can select one of three voices to read the results of a query or summarise news stories from sources such as the bbc and reuters. ""it is still a bit robotic and can make a few mistakes but we are never going to have completely natural sounding voices and it is not bad,"" said speegle founder gordon renton. ""the system is ideal for people with blurred vision or for those that just want to search for something in the background while they do something else. ""we are not saying that it will be suitable for totally blind people, although the royal national institute of the blind (rnib) is looking at the technology,"" he added. but julie howell, digital policy manager at the rnib, expressed doubts over whether speegle and similar sites added anything to blind people's experience of the web. ""there are a whole lot of options like this springing up on the web and one has to think carefully about what the market is going to be,"" she said. ""blind people have specialised screen readers available to them which will do the job these technologies do in a more sophisticated way,"" she added.

the site uses a technology dubbed panavox, which takes web text and converts it into synthesised speech. in the past speech technology has only been compatible with broadband because of the huge files it downloads but cec says its compression technology means it will also work on slower dial-up connections. visitors to speegle may notice that the look and feel of the site bears more than a passing resemblance to the better known, if silent, search engine google. google has no connection with speegle and the use of bright colours is simply to make the site more visible for those with visual impairments, said mr renton. ""it is not a rip-off. we are doing something that google does not do and is not planning to do and there is truth in the saying that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,"" he said. speegle is proving popular with those learning english in countries such as japan and china. ""the site is bombarded by people just listening to the words. the repetition could be useful although they may all end up talking like robots,"" said mr renton.

289,"tories 'would cut number of mps'

the conservative party would cut the number of mps by about one-fifth if they were elected, tory leader michael howard has said.

the plan forms part of the party's ""smaller government bill"", to be unveiled later this week. mr howard told the sunday times the party would also reduce the number of government special advisers. and he said a referendum would be held in wales to decide whether or not to scrap the welsh assembly.

the changes would all take place within five years of the conservatives winning a general election, mr howard told the paper.

the precise number of mps to go would depend on the result of the welsh referendum, but it would probably mean a reduction of around 120 from the current total of 659. if wales decided to keep its assembly it would stand to lose more mps. mr howard said as both parties planned to cut the number of civil servants at whitehall - labour by more than 80,000 and the tories by almost 100,000 - they should accept a similar drop in their own numbers. ""it is all very well saying government departments should be reduced, but what about ministers, parliament and special advisers?"" he said. shadow leader of the commons oliver heald said: ""this will be part of our aim to reduce unnecessary and costly interference in people's lives by reducing the size and role of the state"".

mr howard said the plan would also even out the ""great unfairness"" of there being proportionately more scottish and welsh mps at westminster than those from england. the average size of an english constituency was 70,000 people, mr howard said. in northern ireland it was just over 66,000, in wales just over 59,000 and in scotland 53,000. the number of welsh mps would be set at an amount that was ""consistent and fair in terms of representation with the rest of the united kingdom"" if the assembly was scrapped. mr howard said the changes should be carried out quickly and could even be implemented by the election after next. ""you have got to have a big bang. we don't want this like the house of lords reform, getting to one stage and then not having the next stage.""

725,"italy 17-28 ireland

two moments of magic from brian o'driscoll guided ireland to a workmanlike victory against italy.

a pair of classic outside breaks from the ireland captain set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer. italy led 9-8 early in the second half but stringer's try gave ireland a lead they never lost. the hosts cut the gap to 18-12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through ludovico nitoglia, but denis hickie's try ensured an irish victory. italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through a luciano orquera penalty after seven minutes.

it could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and ireland drew level with a ronan o'gara penalty midway through the first half. the italians were driving at the heart of the irish defence and, for the first quarter, the irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs.

when they finally did, just before the half-hour mark, o'driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for murphy. the ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the full-back and putting the diving murphy in at the corner. o'gara missed the twice-taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again. roland de marigny took over the kicking duties for italy from the hapless orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge italy into a 9-8 lead.

the only ireland player offering a real threat was o'driscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors. shane horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and stringer scooted over, with o'gara landing the tricky conversion. a penalty apiece saw ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter, but they were lucky to survive when italy launched a series of attacks. winger nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul.

an o'gara penalty put ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when hickie latched onto an inside pass from murphy and crossed for a converted try. o'driscoll limped off late on, joining centre partner gordon d'arcy on the sidelines, and the final word went to italy. prop martin castrogiovanni powered over for a try which was fitting reward for an italian pack which had kept the irish under pressure throughout.

1165,"the force is strong in battlefront

the warm reception that has greeted star wars: battlefront is a reflection not of any ingenious innovation in its gameplay, but of its back-to-basics approach and immense nostalgia quotient.

geared towards online gamers, it is based around little more than a series of all-out gunfights, set in an array of locations all featured in, or hinted at during, the two blockbusting film trilogies. previous star wars titles like the acclaimed knights of the old republic and jedi knight have regularly impressed with their imaginative forays into the far corners of the franchise's extensive universe, and their use of weird and wonderful new characters. battlefront on the other hand wholeheartedly revisits the most recognisable elements of the hit movies themselves.

the sights, sounds and protagonists on show here will all be instantly familiar to fans, who may well feel that the opportunity to relive star wars' most memorable screen skirmishes makes this the game they have always waited for. the mayhem can be viewed from either a third or first-person perspective, and you can either fight for the forces of freedom or join darth vader on the dark side, depending on the episode and type of campaign as well as the player's personal propensity for good or evil.

there is ample chance to be a wookie, shoot ewoks and rush into battle alongside a fired-up luke skywalker. in each section, the task is simply to wipe out enemy troops, seize strategic waypoints and move on to the next planet. it really is no more complicated than that. locations include the frozen wastes of hoth, the ice planet from the empire strikes back, complete with massive mechanical at-ats on the march. there are also the dusty, sinister deserts of tatooine and geonosis, as well as the forest moon of endor, where return of the jedi's much-maligned ewoks lived. the feel of those places is well and truly captured, with both backdrops and characters looking good and very authentic. it is worth noting though that on the playstation 2, the game's graphics are a curiously long way behind those of the xbox version. the pivotal element behind battlefront's success is that it successfully gives you the feel of being of being plunged into the midst of large-scale war. the number of combatants, noise and abundance of laser fire see to that, and the sense of chaos really comes over.

speaking of noise, battlefront is a real testament to the strength of the star wars galaxy's audio motifs.

the multitude of distinctive weapon and vehicle noises are immensely familiar, as are the stirring john williams symphonies that never let up. there is also a particularly snazzy remix of one of his themes in the menu section. it has to be said if the game did not have the boon of being star wars, it would not stand up for long. the gameplay is reliable, bog-standard stuff, short on originality. there are also odd annoyances, like the game's insistence on re-spawning you miles away from the action, an irritating price to pay for not getting blown up the second you appear. and some of the weapons and vehicles are not as responsive and fluid to operate as they might be. that said, it is still great fun to pilot a scout walker or speeder bike, however non user-friendly they prove. whilst it is firmly designed with multiplayer action in mind, battlefront is actually perfectly good fun as an offline game. the above-average ai of the enemy sees to that, although given the frenetic environments they operate in, their strategic behaviour does not need to be all that sophisticated. battlefront's novelty value will doubtless wear off relatively fast, leaving behind a slightly empty one-trick-pony of a game. but for a while, it is an absolute blast, and one of the most immediately satisfying video game offerings yet from george lucas' stable.

1918,"indonesia 'declines debt freeze'

indonesia no longer needs the debt freeze offered by the paris club group of creditors, economics minister aburizal bakrie has reportedly said.

indonesia, which originally accepted the debt moratorium offer, owes the paris club about $48bn (â£25.5bn). mr bakrie told the bisnis indonesia newspaper that a $1.7bn donors' aid package meant that the debt moratorium was unnecessary. this aid comes on top of a previously-pledged $3.4bn package. most of this 'normal aid' would be used to finance the country's budget deficit. the indonesian economics minister explained that the money - $1.2bn in grants and $500m in soft loans - was for the rebuilding of aceh province, which was badly hit by the tsunami of 26 december. nevertheless, one of mr bakrie's deputies, mahendra siregar, told afp news agency that indonesia was still considering the offer by the paris club of rich creditor nations to temporarily suspend its debt payments. ""what is true is that we are still discussing... the paris club decision to find out more details such as how much of our debt will be subject to a moratorium. that's how far we are at this stage,"" said mr siregar.

the 19 member countries of the paris club are owed about $5bn this year in debt repayments by nations affected by the indian ocean tsunami. indonesia, sri lanka and the seychelles accepted the paris club offer, which was criticised by some aid groups as being too little. thailand and india have however declined the offer, with thailand prefering to keep up with its payments while india said it would prefer to rely on its own resources rather than on international aid. putting off payments may lower a country's rating among financial organisations, making it more expensive and more difficult for them to borrow money in the future, analysts said. separately, the indonesian government has said it will announce monthly how much it has received in foreign donations and how it has spent the money. welfare minister alwi shihab told ap news agency that this announcement should allay suspicion of official corruption in relief operations.

2160,"us seeks new $280bn smoker ruling

the us justice department is to try to overturn a court ruling that threw out its claim for $280bn (â£149bn) in damages from tobacco firms.

earlier this month, a three-judge appeal court panel rejected the claim - filed in 1999 by the administration of bill clinton - in a 2-1 decision. government lawyers said they would ask the full us court of appeals for the district of columbia to hear the case. the court room battle is seen as key in government attempts to fight smoking. ""it's pretty clear that they've suffered a severe setback,"" said anthony sebok, a professor at brooklyn law school, adding that the appeal was what the government ""would be expected to ask for"".

prosecutors had argued that tobacco firms lied about the dangers of smoking, ignored research that highlighted problems, looked to increase addiction by manipulating nicotine levels and targeted the young with their adverts. among the firms accused were altria group, rj reynolds tobacco, lorillard tobacco, liggett group and brown and williamson. prosecutors went after the companies using legislation put in place to fight organised crime, and accused the firms of conspiring and running ""racketeer influenced and corrupt organisations"". the tobacco companies denied the charges, saying that they never illegally conspired to promote smoking and fool the public. they also said that they have met many of the government's demands laid out in a landmark $206bn settlement hammered out in 1998 with 46 states. a three-judge panel agreed with the companies, finding that the case could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws.

central to the government's case was a meeting in the plaza hotel, new york, on 15 december, 1953. prosecutors contend that executives from the major tobacco firms met and agreed to present a unified strategy denying the harmful effects of smoking. despite denying for decades that smoking could be linked to illness, the companies have modified their stances in recent years. altria's philip morris now accepts that nicotine is harmful, and the company's main lawyer william ohlemeyer told the bbc last year that earlier statements may have been wrong but they were not dishonest. government lawyers have until 21 march to file their appeal.

1931,"green reports shun supply chain

nearly 20% more uk top 250 firms produced non-financial reports on social and environment issues than last year.

but of the 145 companies reporting, 76% didn't examine their supply chains, says the annual directions survey. green groups say putting pressure on supply chains is a major way companies can reduce their environmental impact. the survey is published by corporate social responsibility firm context and branding firm salterbaxter.

blake lee-harwood, campaigns director at greenpeace in the uk, said: ""it's fairly meaningless to talk about your company's direction in terms of sustainability without having detailed knowledge of your supply chain. ""it's also important to get some kind of independent assessment of your reporting.""

less than a quarter of companies (24%) get their corporate social responsibility (csr) reports independently verified to provide assurances they are accurate and complete, says the survey. to date there are no set standards for non-financial reporting, although the global reporting initiative, an independent pro-sustainability institution, is planning to establish some. the reports surveyed by directions are published voluntarily. they are usually called corporate social responsibility (csr) reports, sustainability reports, or social and environmental reports.

peter knight, director of context, says 24 uk top 250 companies reported for the first time this year and, in general, the quality of reports has improved. ""the corporate lexicon of homilies, generalities and soft assurances - fluff - is on its way out. there are less pictures of smiling children and butterflies."" the uk government will soon require all quoted companies to report their social and environmental risks in a chapter in their annual reports, called the operating and financial review. the regulation is not expected until 2005 and the first reports under this scheme will not be published before 2006. the us seems to lag europe in producing corporate social responsibility reports. the majority of european top 50 companies (44) publish them and only 27 of the us top 50.

1666,"bening makes awards breakthrough

film actress annette bening is up for an oscar for her starring role in the award-winning film being julia.

bening, who was born in texas in 1958, has gained prominence for a string of key roles. although an oscar has so far eluded her, her status as one of hollywood's favourite actresses remains solid. one of the biggest oscars buzzes in recent years was for bening's role as troubled carolyn burnham in 1999's american beauty. but her deliciously neurotic portrayal of surburban life turning sour was overlooked in favour of hilary swank's leading role in boys don't cry. after opening her career in the theatre - and gaining a tony award nomination in 1986 - bening had a low-key spell in television. she then made her film debut as a sex-starved wife in 1988's the great outdoors, opposite comics dan akroyd and john candy.

following a cameo in postcards from the edge, bening's breakthrough role came in 1990, playing seductive con artist myra langtry in the grifters - a role that won her an oscar nomination. despite some rave reviews, bening did not win the best supporting actress academy award.

however the high-profile performance enabled bening to capture roles in a number of big budget hollywood productions, co-starring with some of hollywood's greatest players, including robert de niro and harrison ford. but it was her role opposite warren beatty in 1991 gangster flick bugsy which had the greatest impact. bening played virginia hill, another role which won her high critical acclaim, but the film only picked up two of a staggering 12 oscar nominations.

bugsy was the start of a very significant liaison for bening - she married beatty, with whom she had a child as the couple promoted the film in europe. the couple now have four children together. a pair of contrasting yet successful performances peppered bening's career in the mid-1990s. she played michael douglas' opposite number in romantic comedy the american president, and as a ""fiery"" queen elizabeth i in a contemporary adaptation of shakespeare's richard iii.

bening was the first choice to play the female lead in american beauty, director sam mendes' film debut which was a critical and commercial success - but the actress had to be content with a bafta award for her strong performance. but current film being julia has made bening an award-winning actress rather than the perennial nominee, with success at the golden globes. the witty tale of revenge and love set in 1930s london sees the eponymous theatrical diva - played by bening - grow tired of her success and fall for a young american - and could be the role which finally wins her the coveted academy award.

the spanish goalkeeper saved from alan quinn and jon harley as arsenal sealed a quarter-final trip to bolton with a 4-2 victory on penalties. lauren, patrick vieira, freddie ljungberg and ashley cole scored for arsenal, while andy gray and phil jagielka were on target for the blades. michael tonge and harley wasted chances for the underdogs, but paddy kenny was inspired to keep arsenal at bay. arsenal, stripped of attacking talent such as thierry henry and dennis bergkamp, partnered 17-year-old italian striker arturo lupoli with ljungberg up front. it was a revamped arsenal line-up, and they were almost a goal behind within seconds as tonge wasted a glorious chance. gray ran free down the right flank, and his cross left tonge with the simplest of chances, but he blazed over the top from six yards.

arsenal were barely seen as an attacking force in the opening 45 minutes, although ljungberg turned a half-chance wide after good work by cesc fabregas. arsene wenger introduced quincy owusu-abeyie for the ineffective lupoli at half-time, and the pacy dutch youngster had an immediate impact. he ran clear after good work by mathieu flamini, but his finish was tame and kenny saved easily. owusu-abeyie then fired in a testing cross, which was met by fabregas, and it needed a desperate clearance by kenny's legs to save the blades. arsenal were now totally dominant, and were desperately unlucky not to take the lead after 62 minutes when fabregas crashed a rising drive against the bar from 20 yards. it then took a brilliant tackle by jagielka to deny ljungberg as he was poised to strike. arsenal continued to press, and once again kenny was called into action with eight minutes left, diving low to clutch another close-range effort from fabregas. neil warnock's side almost snatched victory in the dying seconds when derek geary's cross found harley at the far post, but his diving header was brilliantly turned over by almunia. owusu-abeyie's pace was causing all sorts of problems for the blades, and as extra-time began, another surging run into the penalty area almost set up a chance for ljungberg. pascal cygan missed arsenal's best chance after 106 minutes, blazing across the face of goal when he was unmarked at the far post. arsenal sent on jeremie aliadiere with seven minutes of extra-time left, and he almost broke the deadlock with his first touch. kolo toure's misplaced free-kick landed at his feet, but kenny once again blocked from a tight angle. arsenal laid siege to sheffield united's goal in the dying minutes, but they somehow held on to force penalties. almunia was then arsenal's hero as another brave blades cup campaign came to a losing end.

404,"custody death rate 'shocks' mps

deaths in custody have reached ""shocking"" levels, a committee of mps and peers has warned.

the joint committee on human rights found those committing suicide were mainly the most vulnerable, with mental health, drugs or alcohol problems. members urged the government to set up a task force to tackle deaths in prisons, police cells, detention centres and special hospitals. there was one prison suicide every four days between 1999 and 2003, mps said. the report, which followed a year-long inquiry by the committee, found the high death rate ""amounts to a serious failure to protect the right to life of a highly vulnerable group"".

many of those who ended up taking their own lives had ""presented themselves"" to the authorities with these problems before they even offended, the report said. it questioned whether prison was the most appropriate place for them to be kept and whether earlier intervention would have meant custody could have been avoided.

increased resources and a reduction in the use of imprisonment was needed to address the issue in the longer term, the report said. committee chairman labour mp jean corston said: ""each and every death in custody is a death too many, regardless of the circumstances.

""yet throughout our inquiry we have seen time and time again that extremely vulnerable people are entering custody with a history of mental illness, drug and alcohol problems and potential for taking their own lives."" ""these highly vulnerable people are being held within a structure glaringly ill-suited to meet even their basic needs. ""crime levels are falling but we are holding more people in custody than ever before. the misplaced over-reliance on the prison system for some of the most vulnerable people in the country is at the heart of the problems that we encountered. ""until we change our whole approach to imprisoning vulnerable people we cannot begin to meet our positive obligations under article 2 of the european convention on human rights and meet our duty of care to them.""

the committee also highlighted ""deeply worrying"" cases of children and young people taking their own lives. between 1990 and 2004, 25 children have taken their own lives in prison and two have died in secure training centres. it picked out the case of joseph scholes, who hanged himself from the bars of his cell in stoke heath young offender institution in march 2002, and urged the home secretary to hold a public inquiry. it revealed that two weeks before his court appearance for a series of robberies, the 16-year-old was depressed, exhibiting suicidal tendencies and slashed his face with a knife about 30 times. even though the trial judge had been alerted to his experience of sexual abuse and mental illness, he was sentenced to a two-year detention and training order. nine days into his sentence, joseph hung himself from the bars of his cell window with a sheet.

russian media reported that india and russia signed a memorandum of understanding on energy co-operation on tuesday during a meeting between oil and natural gas corporation chairman subir raha, gazprom chairman aleksey miller and india's petroleum minister mani shankar aiyar.

the agreement is likely to see the two companies develop refining facilities in russia, india and elsewhere and organise delivery of oil, gas and petrochemicals from russia to india and other countries across asia. ongc could invest in gas and oil fields in sakhalin, in the far east of russia, and may also take part in joint tender bids for projects in eastern siberia and the caspian sea.

india is urgently searching for fresh energy supplies - particularly liquefied natural gas - as domestic demand is growing at more than 5% a year.

ongc's mr raha said the two could work together on joint bids from next year. ""at current oil and gas prices, our cash flow situation is good,"" he told reuters. ""what we are saying is - gazprom has a huge amount of gas and we have the money. ""the investment may go up to $20bn or more for a period of five years or so.""

russian news agencies reported that india's petroleum minister mr aiyar and russian energy minister viktor khristenko would discuss the future of yugansk at a meeting on tuesday. ongc's mr raha declined to be drawn on his firm's reported interest in the company. however, he stressed that ongc was not interested in a 'loan-for-oil deal' in connection to yugansk, similar to that concluded recently between rosneft and china's national petroleum corporation. ""china's problem is it has immediate demand and they needed the oil for their coastal refineries. we do not. we would like long-term security through equity participation."" it is thought that any decision over yugansk will be delayed until a us court has decided whether to grant yukos bankruptcy protection. yukos is suing a host of companies involved in the sale of yugansk, auctioned off to pay a huge back-tax bill. it has also threatened legal action against any business which has future commercial dealings with its former subsidiary.

1122,"wi-fi web reaches farmers in peru

a network of community computer centres, linked by wireless technology, is providing a helping hand for poor farmers in peru.

the pilot scheme in the huaral valley, 80 kilometres north of the capital lima, aims to offer the 6,000-strong community up-to-date information on agricultural market prices and trends. the agricultural information project for farmers of the chancay-huaral valley also provides vital links between local organisations in charge of water irrigation, enabling them to coordinate their actions. more than 13,000 rural inhabitants, as well as 18,000 students in the region, will also benefit from the telecoms infrastructure.

the 14 telecentres uses only free open source software and affordable computer equipment. the network has been three years in the making and was officially inaugurated in september.

the non-government organisation, cepes (peruvian centre for social studies) led the $200,000 project, also backed by local institutions, the education and agriculture ministries, and european development organisations. ""the plan includes training on computers and internet skills for both operators and users of the system,"" said carlos saldarriaga, technical coordinator at cepes. farmers are also taking extra lessons on how to apply the new information to make the most of their plots of land. the board of irrigation users which runs the computer centres, aims to make the network self-sustainable within three years, through the cash generated by using the telecentres as internet cafes.

one of the key elements of the project is the agricultural information system, with its flagship huaral.org website. there, farmers can find the prices for local produce, as well as information on topics ranging from plague prevention to the latest farming techniques. the system also helps the inhabitants of the chancay-huaral valley to organise their vital irrigation systems. ""water is the main element that unites them all. it is a precious element in peru's coastal areas, because it is so scarce, and therefore it is necessary to have proper irrigation systems to make the most of it,"" mr saldarriaga told the bbc news website. the information network also allows farmers to look beyond their own region, and share experiences with other colleagues from the rest of peru and even around the world.

cepes says the involvement of the farmers has been key in the project's success. ""throughout the last three years, the people have provided a vital thrust to the project; they feel it belongs to them,"" said mr saldarriaga. the community training sessions, attended by an equal number of men and women, have been the perfect showcase for their enthusiasm. ""we have had an excellent response, mainly from young people. but we have also had a great feedback when we trained 40 or 50-year old women, who were seeing a computer for the first time in their lives."" so far, the huaral programme promoters say the experience has been very positive, and are already planning on spreading the model among other farmers' organisations in peru. ""this is a pilot project, and we have been very keen on its cloning potential in other places,"" underlined mr saldarriaga.

the cepes researcher recalls what happened in cuyo, a 50-family community with no electricity, during the construction of the local telecentre site. there it was necessary to build a mini-hydraulic dam in order to generate 2kw worth of power for the computers, the communications equipment and the cabin lights. ""it was already dark when the technicians realised they didn't have any light bulbs to test the generator, so they turned up to the local store to buy light bulbs,"" recalls carlos saldarriaga. ""the logical answer was 'we don't sell any', so they had to wait until the next morning to do the testing."" now, with the wireless network, cuyo as well as the other communities is no longer isolated.

145,"minister defends hunting ban law

the law banning hunting with dogs in england and wales is enforceable and ""very clear"", alun michael has said.

the rural affairs minister said it would become obvious if people flouted the law, which came into force on friday, and pretended they were not. some 270 hunts met legally on saturday killing a total of 91 foxes - only four were accidentally killed by hounds. but anti-hunt campaigners said there had been widespread intimidation of activists monitoring hunts. countryside alliance chairman john jackson said that saturday had been a ""massive demonstration by the rural community of support for hunting"". people had turned out ""to show en masse that the hunting act was a bad law"", he said adding that foxes and other animals had been killed ""legally"" as far as he was aware.

although hunting with dogs is now a criminal offence, exercising hounds, chasing a scent trail and flushing out foxes to be shot are still legal. addressing claims that the new law was unenforceable, mr michael told bbc radio 4's today programme: ""there has been a lot of spin about this by those that support hunting. ""the reality is that the law is very clear. you can't chase wild mammals with a pack of dogs, whether the wild mammal is a fox or a deer. ""if people do so and pretend they're not it's going to become very clear. you can't hunt accidentally."" mr michael also denied the hunting ban had led to a breakdown of trust between the government and rural communities. he said most people living in the countryside were more concerned with issues like the economy, the health service and their children's future than hunting.

but the league against cruel sports claimed the new act had been broken even though the numbers of foxes killed had fallen. thousands of hunt supporters turned out at 270 hunts across england and wales on the first day of the ban, with anti-hunt groups sending out 100 monitors to check the law was not being broken. there were only four arrests - over alleged hunting of hares in wiltshire - although it was not clear whether they were made under the hunting act.

they have been released on bail but police say they may face prosecution under new poaching laws. but penny little, who monitored the bicester hunt in oxfordshire, said she had witnessed ""gratuitous, spiteful killing of foxes"". if people tried to ""run circles around this law"" the only outcome would be that it was tightened up, she said. mike hobday, from the league against cruel sports, said video evidence of the law being broken would be passed onto police. he said intimidation seemed to have been widespread and called on hunts to do more to stop their supporters intimidating anti-hunt activists videoing hunts. but mr jackson, who had been at the bicester hunt in oxfordshire, denied there was any intimidation.

details are contained in a royal commission report for the uk government, along with the more controversial idea of closing some mixed fishing grounds completely. six members of the committee will be in scotland to seek views from fishermen and processors in aberdeen and peterhead. they will also speak to mr finnie, representatives of the royal society and the sea fish industry authority. committee chairman austin mitchell said some way has to be found of harvesting mixed fisheries without wasting stocks.

south korea will boost state spending next year in an effort to create jobs and kick start its sputtering economy.

it has earmarked 100 trillion won ($96bn) for the first six months of 2005, 60% of its total annual budget. the government's main problems are ""slumping consumption and a contraction in the construction industry"". it aims to create 400,000 jobs and will focus on infrastructure and home building, as well as providing public firms with money to hire new workers.

the government has set an economic growth rate target of 5% for next year and hinted that would be in danger unless it took action. ""internal and external economic conditions are likely to remain unfavourable in 2005,"" the finance and economy ministry said in a statement.

it blamed ""continuing uncertainties such as fluctuating oil prices and foreign exchange rates and stagnant domestic demand that has shown few signs of a quick rebound"". in 2004, growth will be between 4.7% and 4.8%, the ministry said. not everyone is convinced the plan will work. ""our primary worry centres on the what we believe is the government's overly optimistic view that its front loading of the budget will be enough to turn the economy around,"" consultancy 4cast said in a report.

the problem facing south korea is that many consumers are reeling from the effects of a credit bubble that only recently burst. millions of south koreans are defaulting on their credit card bills, and the country's biggest card lender has been hovering on the verge of bankruptcy for months. as part of its spending plans, the government said it will ask firms to ""roll over mortgage loans that come due in the first half of 2005"" . it also pledged to look at ways of helping families on low incomes.

the government voiced concern about the effect of redundancies in the building trade. ""given the economic spill over and employment effect in the construction sector, a sharp downturn in the construction industry could have other adverse effects,"" the ministry said.

as a result, south korea will give private companies also will be given the chance to build schools, hospitals, houses and other public buildings. it also will look at real estate tax system. other plans on the table include promoting new industries such as bio-technology and nano-technology, as well as offering increased support to small and medium sized businesses. ""the focus will be on job creation and economic recovery, given that unfavourable domestic and global conditions are likely to dog the korean economy in 2005,"" the ministry said.

asian governments and international agencies are reeling at the potential economic devastation left by the asian tsunami and floods.

world bank president james wolfensohn has said his agency is ""only beginning to grasp the magnitude of the disaster"" and its economic impact. the tragedy has left at least 25,000 people dead, with sri lanka, thailand, india and indonesia worst hit. some early estimates of reconstruction costs are starting to emerge. millions have been left homeless, while businesses and infrastructure have been washed away.

economists believe several of the 10 countries hit by the giant waves could see a slowdown in growth.

in sri lanka, some observers have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. for thailand, that figure is much lower at 0.1%. governments are expected to take steps, such as cutting taxes and increasing spending, to facilitate a recovery.

""with the enormous displacement of people...there will be a serious relaxation of fiscal policy,"" glenn maguire, chief economist for the region at societe generale, told agence france presse. ""the economic impact of it will certainly be large, but it should not be enough to derail the momentum of the region in 2005,"" he said. ""first and foremost this is a human tragedy."" india's economy, however, is less likely to slow because the areas hit are some of the least developed. the regional giant has enjoyed strong growth in 2004. but india now faces other problems, with aid workers under pressure to ensure a clean supply of water and sanitation to prevent an outbreak of disease.

thailand's prime minister thaksin shinawatra has estimated the destruction at 20bn baht ($510m). analysts said that figure is likely to rise and the country's tourist industry is likely to be hardest hit. thailand's fishing and real estate sectors also will be affected by sunday's 9.0 magnitude earthquake, which sent huge waves from malaysia to africa. malaysia said as many as 1,000 fishermen will be affected and that damage to the industry will be ""significant"", agence france presse reported. rapid rebuilding will be key to limiting the impact of the tragedy. ""in three months, we should rebuild 70% of the damage in the three worst hit provinces,"" said juthamas siriwan, governor of the tourism authority of thailand. the outlook for sri lanka is less optimistic, with analysts predicting that the country's tourist industry will struggle to recovery quickly. tourism is a vital to many developing countries, providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east asian region, according to the world travel and tourism council (wttc).

""of all the things i do in my life the most exciting thing i've ever done, and the thing i have most loved, is being part of a record company,"" he added.

""the idea of working with brilliant young musicians, and being close to the centre of popular culture, is just the biggest thrill in my life."" wilson explained how his son persuaded him to go and see raw t, but he had initially been reluctant saying he ""detested"" young british people rapping. ""it's always inauthentic, it's always crass, it never really works for me,"" he said.

the story of factory records - which also owned the legendary hacienda club in manchester - was told in the michael winterbottom film 24 hour party people, in which wilson was played by steve coogan.

wilson stressed that the independent music scene remained ""as important"" as it had been during the 1980s, when labels such as factory and rough trade proliferated. he pointed out that franz ferdinand and the white stripes - ""perhaps the two most important bands since the millennium"" - were signed to indies. ""i think that is a reflection of how useful and how powerful the indie philosophy is, and how bands prefer it,"" he added. ""they can make more money that way - it's a more generous relationship, and also it's a more understanding relationship. ""i think independents are in a wonderful position at this moment in time.""

1080,"poles play with gameboy 'blip-pop'

a group of artists in poland has taken the cacophony of blips, boops and beeps created as players bash buttons on nintendo's handheld gameboy console to a new level.

the gameboyzz orchestra project has taken the game sounds to put together music tunes they have dubbed ""blip-pop."" think of it as donkey kong meets norman cook, or maybe tetris takes on kraftwerk. any way you slice it, the sound is distinct. all the sounds are made by six nintendo gameboys, with a mixture of older models and newer advance sp handhelds. the gameboyzz orchestra project tweaks the software a bit, and then connects the units through a mixing board.

jarek kujda, one of the project's founding members has been into electronic music and video games, for a while now.

""i was playing some experimental music and three, four years ago when i first used a gameboy in my band as a drum machine,"" said kujda. he realised that the console could be used as a rudimentary synthesizer. he wondered, if one gameboy can make music, what would happen if he put six of them together? kujda found five other people who were interested and the gameboyzz orchestra project was born. ""gameboyzz orchestra project is more of an improvisational project,"" said kudja. ""we prepare some patterns before a concert, and then improvise during the concert."" the group plays maybe four or five shows a year. malgorzata kujda, jarek's younger sister and a fellow band member, describes a gameboyzz orchestra project concert as a lot of noise. ""for example, i make music with more hard beats and noises,"" she said. ""but each of us makes another music, a different sound. and then in the concert we just improvise, and that i think is more fun for us.""

the gameboyzz orchestra project admits they get mixed reactions from audiences. some love the group's music, and others are not quite sure what to make of it.

in the world of electronic music, these purveyors of blip-pop are not unique. but jarek kujda says they try to be unique. ""we have lots of people making music on old school stuff, electronic old school stuff like commodore, atari, spectrum,"" he said. ""we want to play only experimental music, not cover songs. we're something like an electronic jam session."" the gameboyzz orchestra project's tracks are available online and the group hopes to make a cd next year. and they have sponsorship, courtesy of the polish distributor of nintendo products. the members of the gameboyzz orchestra project do not expect serious competition anytime soon. a gameboy advance costs about us $200 in poland these days, which is still way beyond the reach of most polish gamers, or musicians.

1312,"text messages aid disaster recovery

text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in asia.

the messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation. now some are studying how the technology behind sms could be better used during an emergency. sanjaya senanayake works for sri lankan television. the blogging world, though, might know him better by his online name, morquendi. he was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the sri lankan coast. cell phone signals were weak. land lines were unreliable. so mr senanayake started sending out text messages. the messages were not just the latest news they were also an on-the-ground assessment of ""who needs what and where"". blogging friends in india took mr senanayake's text messages and posted them on a weblog called dogs without borders. thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent.

and that's when mr senanayake started to wonder if sms might be put to more practical use. ""sms networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call,"" he says.

""in every rural community, there's at least one person who has access to a mobile phone, or has a mobile phone, and can receive messages."" half a world away, in the caribbean nation of trinidad and tobago, taran rampersad read morquendi's messages. mr rampersad, who used to work in the military, knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster. he wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages, and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help. mr rampersad said: ""imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets, and had a central place to send a text message to that effect. ""he can message the server, so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field."" he added: ""or, send it at the same time to other people who are using sms in the region, and they might have an excess of it, and be able to shift supplies to the right places.""

mr rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since hurricane ivan ravaged the caribbean and the southern united states last september. last week, he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for asia.

in only 72 hours, he found dan lane, a text message guru living in britain. the pair, along with a group of dedicated techies, are creating what they call the alert retrieval cache. the idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help. ""this is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self-organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people,"" says paul saffo, a director at the california-based institute for the future. ""you may be halfway around the world from someone, but in cyberspace you're just one click or one e-mail away,"" he said, ""that's put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery, where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they're not right on top of the tragedy."" it is still very early days for the project, though. in an e-mail, dan lane calls it ""an early proof of concept."" right now, the alert retrieval cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web-page, or distribute it to an e-mail list. in the near future, the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas, and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages. but there's still another challenge. you have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use. ""it's amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to, and say, look this is what we're trying to do and everything like that,"" says mr rampersad. ""so the big problem right now is the same problem we're trying to solve - human communication."" he is optimistic, however. he thinks that the alert retrieval cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments, too, will sit up and take notice. and he stands by his motto, courtesy of michelangelo: criticise by creating.

scottish conservative party leader david mcletchie claims he has been cleared over a potential conflict of interest.

the edinburgh msp earns up to â£30,000 a year from the law firm tods murray, where he is a partner. mr mcletchie said he has taken advice from holyrood officials about what details he needs to declare. he was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong. as an msp, mr mcletchie signed a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for edinburgh airport.

it then emerged tods murray has a client which opposes the development. mr mcletchie then sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position. bbc scotland's political correspondent glenn campbell said no complaint had been made against mr mcletchie, but questions were raised about his dual role. glenn said msps are advised to guard against a conflict of interests and a perception of a conflict.

mr mcletchie said: ""i'm quite clear that no conflicts of interest arise in my case, that the judgement i took has effectively been vindicated when you look at the advice that has been given to me and that these allegations are unfounded."" he said nothing had changed in respect of his work with the law firm and it was a matter he would have to discuss with the other partners at tods murray.

175,"commons hunt protest charges

eight protesters who stormed the house of commons chamber during a debate on the hunting bill have been charged with disorderly conduct.

the men were arrested in september after bursting into the chamber causing a hunting ban debate to be halted. those charged included otis ferry, the 22-year-old son of rock star bryan ferry and luke tomlinson, 27, a close friend of princes william and harry. they were charged under section 5 of the public order act, police said.

five of the eight men held an impromptu news conference outside charing cross police station on monday evening, after the charges were formerly put to them. the men's solicitor matthew knight, said that at no time had it occurred to the men that they were committing a criminal offence.

""there is no offence of trespassing in the house of commons - it is not a criminal offence,"" he said. ""if parliament wanted to make entering the house of commons chamber on foot a criminal offence it should have done so, but it can't do so retrospectively. ""we are not prosecuted for that. we are prosecuted for a public order act offence. we are not guilty of it."" they will appear at bow street magistrates' court on 21 december, a police spokesman said. otis ferry, a former eton pupil and joint leader of the south shropshire hunt, said: ""i have no regrets. ""we have done nothing wrong beyond the obvious which was to stand up for our rights and not act like a sheep like the rest of the country."" one of the men, david redvers, 34, from hartpury, gloucestershire, said he and the other seven protesters would plead not guilty to the charges.

the other protesters are john holliday, 37, a huntsman from ledbury, herefordshire, robert thame, 34, who plays polo with princes charles in team highgrove, auctioneer andrew elliot, 42, from bromesberrow, near ledbury, point-to-point jockey richard wakeham, 34, from york, and former royal chef nick wood, 41. the 15 september protest came on the same day as a huge pro-hunting demonstration in parliament square. four of the men ran out from behind the speaker's chair while another wrestled past a doorkeeper from a different entrance. the five tried to confront mps before they were bundled out of the chamber and later led away handcuffed by police. three others had been intercepted by security staff as they tried to join the five in the chamber.

speaker michael martin later said the men had used a forged letter to gain access to the house of commons and had been helped to get close to the chamber by a parliamentary pass holder. in november, the use of the parliament act meant a total ban on hunting with dogs in england and wales. however, many pro-hunt activists remained defiant after the law was passed, saying they would ignore the ban and continue to hunt. last week, the countryside alliance said more than 250 hunts would meet legally the day after the ban on hunting with dogs comes into force. the alliance said the 19 february meets would show the new law was ""impossibly difficult to determine"" and open to different interpretations.

1856,"five million germans out of work

germany's unemployment figure rose above the psychologically important level of five million last month.

on wednesday, the german federal labour agency said the jobless total had reached 5.037 million in january, which takes the jobless rate to 12.1%. ""yes, we have effectively more than five million people unemployed,"" a government minister said earlier on zdf public television. unemployment has not been this high in germany since the 1930s.

changes to the way the statistics are compiled partly explain the jump of 572,900 in the numbers. but the figures are embarrassing for the government.

""they could well put an end to the recent renaissance we've seen by the spd [the ruling social democrats] in the polls, and with state elections due in schleswig-holstein and north rhine-westphalia, they may have an adverse effect on the government's chances there.""

the opposition also made political capital from the figures. it said there are a further 1.5 million-2 million people on subsidised employment schemes who are, in fact, looking for real jobs. it added that government reforms, including unpopular benefit cuts, do not go far enough. under the government's controversial ""hartz iv"" reforms, which came into effect at the beginning of the year, both those on unemployment benefits and welfare support and those who are long-term unemployed are officially classified as looking for work. the bad winter weather also took its toll, as key sectors such as the construction sector laid off workers. adjusted for the seasonal factors, the german jobless total rose by 227,000 in january from december.

1154,"more power to the people says hp

the digital revolution is focused on letting people tell and share their own stories, according to carly fiorina, chief of technology giant hewlett packard.

the job of firms such as hp now, she said in a speech at the consumer electronics show (ces), was to ensure digital and physical worlds fully converged. she said the goal for 2005 was to make people the centre of technology. ces showcases 50,000 new gadgets that will be hitting the shelves in 2005. the tech-fest, the largest of its kind in the world, runs from 6 to 9 january. ""the digital revolution is about the democratisation of technology and the experiences it makes possible,"" she told delegates. ""revolution has always been about giving power to the people."" she added: ""the real story of the digital revolution is not just new products, but the millions of experiences made possible and stories that millions can tell."" part of giving people more control has been about the freeing up of content, such as images, video and music. crucial to this has been the effort to make devices that speak to each other better so that content can be more easily transferred from one device, such as a digital camera, to others, such as portable media players. a lot of work still needs to be done, however, to sort out compatibility issues and standards within the technology industry so that gadgets just work seamlessly, she said.

ms fiorina's talk also touted the way technology is being designed to focus on lifestyle, fashion and personalisation, something she sees as key to what people want.

special guest, singer gwen stefani, joined her on-stage to promote her own range of hp digital cameras which ms stefani has helped design and which are heavily influenced by japanese youth culture. the digital cameras, which are due to go on sale in the us by the summer, are based on the hp 607 model. the emphasis on personalisation and lifestyle is a big theme at this year's ces, with tiny, wearable mp3 players at every turn and rainbow hues giving colour to everything. ms fiorina also announced that hp was working with nokia to launch a visual radio service for mobiles, which would launch in europe early this year. the service will let people listen to radio on their mobiles and download relevant content, like a track's ringtone, simultaneously. the service is designed to make mobile radio more interactive.

among the other new products she showcased was the digital media hub, a big upgrade to hp's digital entertainment centre. coming out in the autumn in the us, the box is a networked, high-definition tv, cable set-top box, digital video recorder and dvd recorder. it has a removable hard drive cartridge, memory card slots, and light scribe labelling software which lets people design and print customised dvd labels and covers. it is designed to contain all a household's digital media, such as pre-recorded tv shows, pictures, videos and music so it can all be managed in one place. the hub reflects the increasing move to re-box the pc so that it can work as part of other key centres of entertainment. research suggests that about 258 million images are saved and shared every day, equating to 94 billion a year. eighty per cent of those remain on cameras. media hubs are designed to encourage people to organise them on one box. ms fiorina was one of several keynote speakers, who also included microsoft chief bill gates, to set out what major technology companies think people will be doing with technologies and gadgets in the next 12 months. in a separate announcement during the keynote speech, ms fiorina said that hp would be partnering mtv to replace this year's mtv asia music award. mtv's asia aid will be held in bangkok on 3 february, and is aimed at helping to raise money for the asian tsunami disaster.

1102,"warning over windows word files

writing a microsoft word document can be a dangerous business, according to document security firm workshare.

up to 75% of all business documents contained sensitive information most firms would not want exposed, a survey by the firm revealed. to make matters worse 90% of those companies questioned had no idea that confidential information was leaking. the report warns firms to do a better job of policing documents as corporate compliance becomes more binding.

sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms, competitive information that rivals would be keen to see and special deals for key customers, said andrew pearson, european boss of workshare which commissioned the research. ""the efficiencies the internet has brought in such as instant access to information have also created security and control issues too,"" he said. the problem is particularly acute with documents prepared using microsoft word because of the way it maintains hidden records about editing changes. as documents get passed around, worked on and amended by different staff members the sensitive information finds its way into documents. poor control over the editing and amending process can mean that information that should be expunged survives final edits. microsoft, however, does provide an add-on tool for windows pcs that fixes the problem. ""the remove hidden data add-in is a tool that you can use to remove personal or hidden data that might not be immediately apparent when you view the document in your microsoft office application,"" says the instructions on microsoft's website. microsoft recommends that the tool is used before people publish any word document. a tool for apple machines running word is not available. workshare surveyed firms around the world and found that, on average, 31% of documents contained legally sensitive information but in many firms up to three-quarters fell in to the high risk category. often, said mr pearson, this sensitive information was invisible because it got deleted and changed as different drafts were prepared.

however, the way that windows works means that earlier versions can be recalled and reconstructed by those keen to see how a document has evolved. few firms have any knowledge of the existence of this so-called metadata about the changes that a document has gone through or that it can be reconstructed. the discovery of this hidden information could prove embarrassing for companies if, for instance, those tendering for contracts found out about the changes to terms of a deal being negotiated. the research revealed that a document's metadata could be substantial as, on average, only 40% of contributors' changes to a document make it to the final draft. problems with documents could mean trouble for firms as regulatory bodies step up scrutiny and compliance laws start to bite, said mr pearson.

british actress antonia bernath is making her debut in kisna - the warrior poet, marking a growing trend for non-indian stars to appear in bollywood films.

directed by bollywood veteran subhash ghai, the film is set in the british raj and bernath plays an army general's daughter who falls in love with a rural boy, kisna. ""i liked the fluid nature of film-making. we improvised quite a lot,"" says bernath. ""at times it felt very chaotic but mr ghai was quite clear about what he wanted."" picked from more than 200 girls in an audition in london, bernath cut short her education at bristol's old vic theatre school to take up the opportunity. it is not often that somebody gets to play the lead role straight out of a drama school. she spent three weeks learning hindi and taking dance lessons. ""initially, i was a bit sceptical about how people would respond to me,"" bernath says. ""but i found the hindi film industry very warm and encouraging. i even had a few offers before the work on kisna was completed.""

films are one of india's biggest exports and those like lagaan and monsoon wedding have broken the traditional boundaries of colour and culture. spurred by this, bollywood producers are trying to go global in all aspects of film-making, be it technical or artistic.

from young heart-throbs like nick moran of lock, stock and two smoking barrels to model sophie dahl, many non-indian stars want to make the most of this opportunity. ""bollywood has truly gone global,"" says taran adarsh, editor of indian film journal trade guide. ""directors are now attempting to woo non-asian audience to increase their share in the overseas film market."" kisna has been shot simultaneously in hindi and english, with the english print shortened by an hour to accommodate the western audience. the film even has a song composed in english by ar rahman, the director of the popular west end musical, bombay dreams. ""identification is a popular cinematic device. use of european or american actors can be viewed as a step in that direction,"" says adarsh.

the cast of kisna also includes british actors michael maloney, caroline langrishe and polly adams.

another actress, annabelle wallace, plays the lead role in a bilingual romantic comedy dil jo bhi kahey (whatever the heart says), which also stars indian screen legend amitabh bachchan. actor and producer aamir khan's forthcoming venture the rising is set against the backdrop of the indian mutiny of 1857, with british actor toby stephens in a key role. but it isn't only the western actors looking eastwards. bollywood sweetheart aishwarya rai, recently seen in bride and prejudice alongside new zealand actor martin henderson, is building her international career. and, many other bollywood stars have their eyes set on hollywood. ""hollywood or bollywood, it's the box office that determines whether something is a passing phase or a trend,"" says adarsh.

kisna - the warrior poet opens in the uk on 21 january.

two big us names have launched advertising campaigns to ""set the record straight"" about their products and corporate behaviour.

the world's biggest retailer wal-mart took out more than 100 full page adverts in national newspapers. the group is trying to see off criticism over it pay deals, benefits package and promotion strategy. meanwhile, drugs group eli lilly is planning a campaign against ""false"" claims about its product prozac. wal-mart kicked off the battle with adverts in newspapers like the wall street journal, using an open letter from company president lee scott saying it was time for the public to hear the ""unfiltered truth"".

""there are lots of 'urban legends' going around these days about wal-mart, but facts are facts. wal-mart is good for consumers, good for communities and good for the us economy,"" mr scott said in a separate statement.

its adverts - and a new website - outlined the group's plans to create more than 10,000 us jobs in 2005. wal-mart's average pay is almost twice the national minimum wage of $5.15 (â£3.90) an hour, while employees are offered health and life insurance, company stock and a retirement plan, the adverts say. unions accuse wal-mart of paying staff less than its rivals do, with fewer benefits. in california, the company is fighting opposition to new stores amid allegations it forces local competitors out of business. lawmakers in the state are also examining allegations that the firm burdens the state with an unfair proportion of employee health care costs. ""i think they are going to have a tough time suddenly overcoming the perceptions of some people,"" said larry bevington, chairman of save our community - a group fighting to prevent wal-mart opening a store in rosemead, california. wal-mart is also fighting two lawsuits - one accusing it of discriminating against women and another alleging it discriminates against black employees.

meanwhile eli lilly is launching a series of adverts in a dozen major newspapers, to present what is says are the true facts about its anti-depressant drug prozac.

the move is in response to a british medical journal article that claimed ""missing"" lilly documents linked prozac to suicide and violent behaviour. in the averts, entitled an open letter from chief executive sidney taurel, the company says the article continues to ""needlessly spread fear among patients who take prozac"". ""it was simply wrong to suggest that information on prozac was missing, or that important research data on the benefits and possible side effects of the drug were not available to doctors and regulators,"" the letter added. eli lilly's chief medical officer alan breier said that the article was ""false and misleading"" as the documents it referred to were actually created by officials at the us food and drug administration (fda) and presented to an fda meeting in 1991. later, fda medical advisors agreed the claims were based on faulty data and there was no increased risk of suicide.

1798,"worldcom ex-boss launches defence

lawyers defending former worldcom chief bernie ebbers against a battery of fraud charges have called a company whistleblower as their first witness.

cynthia cooper, worldcom's ex-head of internal accounting, alerted directors to irregular accounting practices at the us telecoms giant in 2002. her warnings led to the collapse of the firm following the discovery of an $11bn (â£5.7bn) accounting fraud. mr ebbers has pleaded not guilty to charges of fraud and conspiracy.

prosecution lawyers have argued that mr ebbers orchestrated a series of accounting tricks at worldcom, ordering employees to hide expenses and inflate revenues to meet wall street earnings estimates. but ms cooper, who now runs her own consulting business, told a jury in new york on wednesday that external auditors arthur andersen had approved worldcom's accounting in early 2001 and 2002. she said andersen had given a ""green light"" to the procedures and practices used by worldcom. mr ebber's lawyers have said he was unaware of the fraud, arguing that auditors did not alert him to any problems.

ms cooper also said that during shareholder meetings mr ebbers often passed over technical questions to the company's finance chief, giving only ""brief"" answers himself. the prosecution's star witness, former worldcom financial chief scott sullivan, has said that mr ebbers ordered accounting adjustments at the firm, telling him to ""hit our books"". however, ms cooper said mr sullivan had not mentioned ""anything uncomfortable"" about worldcom's accounting during a 2001 audit committee meeting. mr ebbers could face a jail sentence of 85 years if convicted of all the charges he is facing. worldcom emerged from bankruptcy protection in 2004, and is now known as mci. last week, mci agreed to a buyout by verizon communications in a deal valued at $6.75bn.

944,"mobiles rack up 20 years of use

mobile phones in the uk are celebrating their 20th anniversary this weekend.

britain's first mobile phone call was made across the vodafone network on 1 january 1985 by veteran comedian ernie wise. in the 20 years since that day, mobile phones have become an integral part of modern life and now almost 90% of britons own a handset. mobiles have become so popular that many people use their handset as their only phone and rarely use a landline.

the first ever call over a portable phone was made in 1973 in new york but it took 10 years for the first commercial mobile service to be launched. the uk was not far behind the rest of the world in setting up networks in 1985 that let people make calls while they walked. the first call was made from st katherine's dock to vodafone's head office in newbury which at the time was over a curry house. for the first nine days of 1985 vodafone was the only firm with a mobile network in the uk. then on 10 january cellnet (now o2) launched its service. mike caudwell, spokesman for vodafone, said that when phones were launched they were the size of a briefcase, cost about â£2,000 and had a battery life of little more than 20 minutes.

""despite that they were hugely popular in the mid-80s,"" he said. ""they became a yuppy must-have and a status symbol among young wealthy business folk."" this was also despite the fact that the phones used analogue radio signals to communicate which made them very easy to eavesdrop on. he said it took vodafone almost nine years to rack up its first million customers but only 18 months to get the second million. ""it's very easy to forget that in 1983 when we put the bid document in we were forecasting that the total market would be two million people,"" he said. ""cellnet was forecasting half that."" now vodafone has 14m customers in the uk alone. cellnet and vodafone were the only mobile phone operators in the uk until 1993 when one2one (now t-mobile) was launched. orange had its uk launch in 1994. both newcomers operated digital mobile networks and now all operators use this technology. the analogue spectrum for the old phones has been retired. called global system for mobiles (gsm) this is now the most widely used phone technology on the planet and is used to help more than 1.2 billion people make calls. mr caudwell said the advent of digital technology also helped to introduce all those things, such as text messaging and roaming that have made mobiles so popular.

946,"when technology gets personal

in 2020, whipping out your mobile phone to make a call will be quaintly pass&#233;. by then phones will be printed directly on to wrists, or other parts of the body, says ian pearson, bt's resident futurologist.

it's all part of what's known as a ""pervasive ambient world"", where ""chips are everywhere"". mr pearson does not have a crystal ball. his job is to formulate ideas based on what science and technology are doing now, to guide industries into the future. inanimate objects will start to interact with us: we will be surrounded - on streets, in homes, in appliances, on our bodies and possibly in our heads - by things that ""think"". forget local area networks - these will be body area networks. ideas about just how smart, small, or even invisible, technology will get are always floating around. images of devices clumsily bolted on to heads or wrists have pervaded thinking about future technology. but now a new vision is surfacing, where smart fabrics and textiles will be exploited to enhance functionality, form, or aesthetics. such materials are already starting to change how gadgets and electronics are used and designed.

so mp3 players - the mass gadget of the moment - will disappear and instead become integrated into one's clothing, says mr pearson. ""so the gadgets that fill up your handbag, when we integrate those into fabric, we can actually get rid of all that stuff. you won't necessarily see the electronics."" wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up, while ""video tattoos"", or intelligent electronic contact lenses, might function as tv screens for those on the move. however, this future of highly personal devices, where technology is worn, or even fuses with the body itself, raises ethical questions. if technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing, jewellery, and skin, there needs to be some serious thinking about what it means for us as humans, says baroness susan greenfield. at a recent conference for technology, engineering, academic and fashion industry experts, at the royal society in london, neuroscientist baroness greenfield cautioned we ""can't just sleepwalk into the future"".

yet this technology is already upon us. researchers have developed computers and sensors worn in clothing. mp3 jackets, based on the idea that electrically conductive fabric can connect to keyboard sewn into sleeves, have already appeared in shops.

these ""smart fabrics"" have come about through advances in nano- and micro-engineering - the ability to manipulate and exploit materials at micro or molecular scale. at the nanoscale, materials can be ""tuned"" to display unusual properties that can be exploited to build faster, lighter, stronger and more efficient devices and systems. the textile and clothing industry has been one of the first to exploit nanotechnology in quite straightforward ways. many developments are appearing in real products in the fields of medicine, defence, healthcare, sports, and communications. professional swimming suits reduce drag by incorporating tiny structures similar to shark skin. nanoscale titanium dioxide (tio2) coatings give fabrics antibacterial and anti-odour properties. these have special properties which can be activated in contact with the air or uv light. such coatings have already been used to stop socks smelling for instance, to turn airline seats into super stain-resistant surfaces, and applied to windows so they clean themselves. dressings for wounds can now incorporate nanoparticles with biocidal properties and smart patches are being developed to deliver drugs through the skin. but baroness greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being. if our clothing, skin, and ""personal body networks"" do the talking and the monitoring, everywhere we go, we have to think about what that means for our concept of privacy. mr pearson picks up the theme, pointing out there are a lot of issues humans have to iron out before we become ""cyborgian"". his main concern is ""privacy"". ""we are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and a lot of that information you really don't want every passer-by to know. ""so we have to make sure we build security in this. if you are wearing smart make-up, where electronics are controlling the appearance, you don't want people hacking in and writing messages on your forehead."" as technology infiltrates our biology, how will our brains function differently? ""we cannot arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this,"" warns baroness greenfield. there have already been successful experiments to grow human nerve cells on circuit boards. this paves the way for brain implants to help paralysed people interface directly with computers. clearly, the organic, carbon of our bodies and silicon is increasingly merging. the cyborg - a very familiar part-human, part-inorganic science fiction and academic idea - is on its way.
","if technology is going to be increasingly part of clothing, jewellery, and skin, there needs to be some serious thinking about what it means for us as humans, says baroness susan greenfield.if our clothing, skin, and ""personal body networks"" do the talking and the monitoring, everywhere we go, we have to think about what that means for our concept of privacy.but baroness greenfield is concerned about how far this more personal contact with technology might affect our very being.however, this future of highly personal devices, where technology is worn, or even fuses with the body itself, raises ethical questions.yet this technology is already upon us.his job is to formulate ideas based on what science and technology are doing now, to guide industries into the future.wearable technology could exploit body heat to charge it up, while ""video tattoos"", or intelligent electronic contact lenses, might function as tv screens for those on the move.such materials are already starting to change how gadgets and electronics are used and designed.at a recent conference for technology, engineering, academic and fashion industry experts, at the royal society in london, neuroscientist baroness greenfield cautioned we ""can't just sleepwalk into the future"".ideas about just how smart, small, or even invisible, technology will get are always floating around.as technology infiltrates our biology, how will our brains function differently?so mp3 players - the mass gadget of the moment - will disappear and instead become integrated into one's clothing, says mr pearson.by then phones will be printed directly on to wrists, or other parts of the body, says ian pearson, bt's resident futurologist.""we are looking at electronics which are really in deep contact with your body and a lot of that information you really don't want every passer-by to know.images of devices clumsily bolted on to heads or wrists have pervaded thinking about future technology.""we cannot arrogantly assume that the human brain will not change with this,"" warns baroness greenfield.mp3 jackets, based on the idea that electrically conductive fabric can connect to keyboard sewn into sleeves, have already appeared in shops.",tech,798,340
1975,"ecb holds rates amid growth fears

the european central bank has left its key interest rate unchanged at 2% for the 19th month in succession.

borrowing costs have remained on hold amid concerns about the strength of economic growth in the 12 nations sharing the euro, analysts said. despite signs of pick-up, labour markets and consumer demand remain sluggish, while firms are eyeing cost cutting measures such as redundancies. high oil prices, meanwhile, have put upward pressure on the inflation rate.

surveys of economists have shown that the majority expect borrowing costs to stay at 2% in coming months, with an increase of a quarter of a percentage point predicted some time in the second half of the year. if anything, there may be greater calls for an interest rate cut, especially with the euro continuing to strengthen against the dollar. ""the euro land economy is still struggling with this recovery,"" said economist dirk schumacher. the ecb ""may sound rather hawkish but once the data allows them to cut again, they will."" data coming out of germany on thursday underlined the problems facing european policy makers. while germany's economy expanded by 1.7% in 2004, growth was driven by export sales and lost some of its momentum in the last three months of the year.

the strength of the euro is threatening to dampen that foreign demand in 2005, and domestic consumption currently is not strong enough to take up the slack. inflation in the eurozone, however, is estimated at about 2.3% in december, above ecb guidelines of 2%. ecb president jean-claude trichet has remained upbeat about prospects for the region, and inflation is expected to drop below 2% later in 2005. the ecb has forecast economic growth in the eurozone of 1.9% in 2005.

209,"brown outlines third term vision

gordon brown has outlined what he thinks should be the key themes of new labour's next general election bid.

he said ensuring every child in britain had the best start in life could be a legacy to match the nhs's creation. the chancellor has previously planned the party's election strategy but this time the role will be filled by alan milburn - a key ally of tony blair. the premier insisted mr brown will have a key role in labour's campaign, and praised his handling of the economy.

writing in the guardian newspaper, mr brown outlined his view of the direction new labour should be taking. ""as our manifesto and our programme for the coming decade should make clear, labour's ambition is not simply tackling idleness but delivering full employment; not just attacking ignorance, disease and squalor but promoting lifelong education, good health and sustainable communities."" bbc political editor andrew marr said that mr brown's article was ""a warning shot"" to mr blair not to try and cut him out of the manifesto writing process. ""it was, as always, coded and careful... but entirely deliberate,"" was mr marr's assessment. the prime minister was asked about mr brown's article and about his election role when he appeared on bbc radio 4's today programme. mr blair said a decision had yet to be taken over how the election would be run but the chancellor's role would be ""central"". mr blair argued that under new labour the country had changed for the better and that was ""in part"" because of mr brown's management of the economy. and he pledged childcare would be a ""centrepiece"" of labour's manifesto. he also predicted the next general election will be a ""tough, tough fight"" for new labour. but the prime minister insisted he did not know what date the poll would take place despite speculation about 5 may. mr blair said he was taking ""nothing for granted"" ahead of the vote - warning that the tory strategy was to win power via the back door by hinting they were aiming to cut labour's majority instead of hoping for an outright win.

683,"middlesbrough 2-2 charlton

a late header by teenager danny graham earned middlesbrough a battling draw with charlton at the riverside.

matt holland had put the visitors ahead in the 14th minute after his shot took a deflection off franck queudrue. but middlesbrough peppered the charlton goal after the break and chris riggott stroked home the equaliser. shaun bartlett's strike put charlton back in front but that lead lasted just six minutes before graham rushed onto queudrue's pass to head home. the match burst to life from the whistle and charlton defender hermann hreidarsson had sight of an open goal after just six minutes. hreidarsson received danny murphy's free-kick from the right but he crashed his free header wide of the far post. the iceland international looked such a danger the boro bench could be heard issuing frantic instructions to mark him.

charlton's early pressure paid off when bartlett received a long ball from talal el karkouri in the box and laid it off to holland who buried his right-footed strike. szilard nemeth, recalled in place of joseph-desire job, was twice denied his chance to get middlesbrough back on level terms by dean kiely. the striker played a great one-two with jimmy floyd hasselbaink only to see kiely get down well to smother his shot before directing a header straight into the keeper's arms. boro had plenty of time on the ball but the addicks comfortably mopped up the pressure - with kiely tipping a hasselbaink header over the bar - to take their lead into half-time.

it was all one-way traffic after the break at the riverside as middlesbrough poured forward and kiely even saved hreidarsson's blushes when he palmed the ball away to prevent a charlton own goal. but the addicks keeper could do nothing about riggott's equaliser in the 74th minute. the boro defender looked suspiciously offside as he got on the end of gareth southgate's misdirected effort, but despite the charlton protests his goal stood. the addicks did not let their heads drop and bartlett left the boro defence standing, picking up hreidarsson's cross to easily sink his right-footed strike. but substitute graham was on hand to grab a share of the points for the home side. the 19-year-old striker nodding home the equaliser - and his first premiership goal - with five minutes left on the clock.

""i felt we did enough to win the game even though the first half was lacklustre. ""we dominated after the break, the players showed a fantastic response and we should have gone on to win. ""but for (charlton goalkeeper) dean kiely, who made three tremendous saves, we could have scored five or six.""

""to take the lead and then to get penned back, it feels a little bit like a defeat,"" admitted kiely. ""we were winning but middlesbrough kept knocking on the door. but we stood up and credit to us we didn't capitulate. ""we'll kick on now. our short-term ambition is to progress from the seventh place finish from last year.""

media giant viacom has paid out $3.5m (â£1.8m) to end investigations into indecency in its us radio and tv shows.

the settlement to the federal communications commission (fcc) ends a long-running saga dating back to 2001. the fcc was looking into 50 shows, including those by ""shock jock"" howard stern and two new york djs. stern recently announced he was leaving viacom while the two djs were sacked after their show featured a couple purporting to have sex in a church. after the church incident two years ago viacom agreed to install audio delay equipment at its radio stations that broadcast live programming.

it also agreed to train its broadcasters and employees about indecency laws. the agreement cancels investigations into about 50 radio and television shows, said richard diamond, fcc deputy secretary of communications. the shows were broadcast by viacom-owned stations across the united states. viacom has five days to pay the $3.5m fine, according to the agreement. the payment is not related to the fcc's $550,000 (â£293,000) fine levied against viacom after the exposure of singer janet jackson's breast during the cbs super bowl halftime show in january. viacom is contesting that fine. it is not the first time that viacom has paid out over indecency charges. infinity broadcasting, which is owned by viacom, paid cumulative fines totalling $1.7m (â£907,000) in 1995 to settle fcc violations by stern.

238,"bid to cut court witness stress

new targets to reduce the stress to victims and witnesses giving evidence in courts in england and wales have been announced by the lord chancellor.

lord falconer wants all crown courts and 90% of magistrates' courts to have facilities to keep witnesses separate from defendants within four years. more video links will also be made available so that witnesses do not have to enter courtrooms. it is part of a five-year plan to help build confidence in the justice system.

ministers say the strategy is aimed at re-balancing the court system towards victims, and increasing the number of offenders brought to justice. launching the department for constitutional affairs' plan, lord falconer said: ""one of the top priorities will be a better deal for victims. ""the needs and safety of victims will be at the heart of the way trials are managed.

""courts, judges, magistrates, prosecutors, police and victim support - all working together to ensure the rights of victims are put first, without compromising the rights of the defendant."" he went on: ""giving evidence is a nerve-wracking experience, especially when you're a victim. ""yet with a will and with support it can be done."" lord falconer told bbc radio 4's today programme it was impossible for some elderly people to go to court to give evidence. other witnesses could be intimidated by sitting alongside defendants outside courts. ""you are never going to get rid of some element of the trauma of giving evidence,"" he said. ""but you can make people believe that the courts understand the problem, it's not some kind of alien place where they go where they are not thinking about them.""

the plan comes as the lord chancellor also considers allowing cameras into courts for the first time since 1925, as long as they were used for cases that did not involve witnesses. another feature of the strategy is constitutional reform, with a government bill to set up a supreme court and a judicial appointments commission returning to the house of lords on tuesday. ministers had proposed getting rid of the title of lord chancellor, but the lords have over-ruled this. lord falconer said it was right for the highest court to be completely distinct from parliament. the person in charge of the court system should not also be speaker of the house of lords, he said, and should be the best person chosen from either house of parliament. what they did, not what they were called, was the critical issue, he added.

1097,"putting a face to 'big brother'

literally putting a face on technology could be one of the keys to improving our interaction with hi-tech gadgets.

imagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour, and perhaps even alert you to new e-mails. basic versions of these so-called avatars already exist. together with speech and voice recognition systems, they could replace the keyboard and mouse in the near future. some of these ideas have been showcased at the london's science museum, as part of its future face exhibition.

one such avatar is jeremiah. it is a virtual man, which you can download for free and install in your computer.

his creator, richard bowden, lecturer at the centre for vision, speech and signal processing at the university of surrey, refers to jeremiah as ""him"", rather than it. ""jeremiah is a virtual face that attempts to emulate humans in the way it responds to activity. he is very childlike, he likes visual stimulus,"" he told the bbc news website. ""when he sees children running and laughing and waving at him, he smiles at them. if you ignore him, he gets angry. if you leave, he gets sad. and you can also even surprise him."" jeremiah is not actually intelligent. it works on vision, reacting in a preset way to the information provided by a surveillance tracker system. it is not able to talk or to hear you, at least not yet. the surrey team is already working on jeremiah's next version, that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature: finn the fish. ""i am interested in the interaction, providing the ability of a system to watch what's going on and make decisions based on that,"" explained dr bowden.

the research comes at a time when people are having to cope with an increasing number of hi-tech gadgets.

experts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices, such as a virtual human, could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos. ""if you get up at three o'clock in the morning, and you go downstairs, there are probably two things you are going to do: either going to the bathroom, or maybe you are going to make a cup of tea,"" said dr bowden. ""now if the system can watch your behaviour over time, it can learn this, so it would predict what you are going to do, turn on the lights for you, or, before you even get to the kettle, it could have switched it on."" you might even be able to tell your home surveillance system that you will be going away on holiday, and ask if it could make sure that the house is secure once you have left. this might sound like a scary vision of an orwellian future. but it might all depend on the face that is watching you. ""when we put the surveillance cameras in our centre, a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them,"" said dr bowden. ""but when jeremiah's camera went in, nobody minded, because although it's still watching them, they could see what it was watching.""

microsoft is planning to make windows and internet explorer more secure by including software to give people more control over personal information.

microsoft is developing a new version of internet explorer browser and its operating system, windows, which has been code-named longhorn. michael stephenson, director in microsoft's windows server division, would not confirm however whether the new info cards id system will be built into the current windows xp version or longhorn.

""we're trying to make the end-user experience as simple as possible,"" mr stephenson said. the system would differ from its previous attempts to make online transactions more secure, said microsoft. while passport and hailstorm stored user information centrally on the net, the latest system will store data on a user's pc. ""it's going to put control of digital ids into the hands of an end-user, the end-user will be in full control,"" said mr stephenson.

hailstorm was criticised by privacy campaigners for putting too much sensitive information into the hands of a single company. passport provides a single log-in for more than one website and stores basic personal information. but its popularity suffered after security scares. up to 200 million passport accounts were left vulnerable to online theft and malicious hackers after a flaw in the system was exploited in 2003. online auction site, ebay, stopped supporting it in january 2005. although the flaw was fixed, microsoft has come under regular criticism for the number of security loopholes in internet explorer. last year, it released a major security update for windows, service pack 2, to combat some of the security concerns. longhorn is due to be released commercially in late 2006, but an updated version of internet explorer is due for release later this year.

spider-man creator stan lee is to get a multi-million dollar windfall after winning a court battle with comic book company marvel.

a judge has upheld lee's demand for 10% of marvel's profits from the hugely successful spider-man films. spider-man and its sequel made $1.6bn (â£857m) at box offices worldwide. of the cut now due to lee, 82, who created spider-man in 1962, his lawyer said: ""it could be tens of millions of dollars, that's no exaggeration."" us district court judge robert w sweet ruled lee should get a tenth of profits generated since november 1998 by marvel tv and movie productions involving the company's characters. lee took legal action in 2002, saying marvel shut him out of ""jackpot"" profits from the first blockbuster film.

sci-fi shooter doom 3 has blasted away the competition at a major games ceremony, the golden joystick awards.

it was the only title to win twice, winning ultimate game of the year and best pc game at the awards, presented by little britain star matt lucas. the much-anticipated sci-fi horror doom 3 shot straight to the top of the uk games charts on its release in august. other winners included grand theft auto: san andreas which took the most wanted for christmas prize. only released last week, it was closely followed by halo 2 and half-life 2, which are expected to be big hits when they are unleashed later this month.

but they missed out on the prize for the most wanted game of 2005, which went to the nintendo title, the legend of zelda. the original doom, released in 1994, heralded a new era in computer games and introduced 3d graphics. it helped to establish the concept of the first-person shooter. doom 3 was developed over four years and is thought to have cost around $15m (â£8.3m). the top honour for the best online game of the year went to battlefield vietnam. the chronicles of riddick: escape from butcher bay was handed the unsung hero game of 2004. its release was somewhat eclipsed by doom 3, which was released on the same week. it was, however, very well received by gamers and was praised for its storyline which differed from the film released around the same time. electronic arts was named top publisher of the year, taking the crown from nintendo which won in 2003. the annual awards are voted for by more than 200,000 readers of computer and video games magazines. games awards like this have grown in importance. over the last six years, the uk market for games grew by 100% and was worth a record â£1,152m in 2003, according to a recent report by analysts screen digest.

1258,"uk broadband gets speed injection

broadband's rapid rise continues apace as speeds gear up a notch.

an eight megabit service has been launched by internet service provider uk online. it is 16 times faster than the average broadband package on the market and will pave the way for services such as video-on-demand and broadband tv. the service is possible due to a new regime which allows other operators to use bt's exchanges and will initially only be available in towns.

it represents a ""big leap forward"" for broadband, said chris stening, uk online general manager.

the service comes with a hefty â£39.99 monthly price tag but will mean users can download mp3s in seconds and offers tv-quality video streaming. the service includes wifi as standard, meaning users can connect multiple pcs, laptops and game consoles from any room in the house. not everybody will be able to take advantage of the service, as it will be restricted to metropolitan areas. the service will initially be available to users within 2km radius of 230 telephone exchanges in areas such as london, birmingham, glasgow and cambridge. that represents about 4.4 million households. the service is possible due to a decision to loosen bt's strangle-hold on telephone exchanges.

the process, known as local loop unbundling, was put in motion by the now defunct telecoms watchdog oftel but has only proved popular in recent months due to falling costs. uk online is looking at the possibility of bundling services such as cheap net telephone calls, video-on-demand and tv by 2005 if the service proves popular. ""the service is twice as fast as any other service on offer in the uk and 16 times faster than most broadband services,"" said mr stening. ""it takes a big leap for broadband and we are very excited about it,"" he said. countries such as south korea and france have found the advantage of upping the speeds of broadband. in south korea, video-on-demand over the net is cheaper than renting a dvd and online gaming is huge. mr stening believes the service will appeal to people in multi-occupancy buildings as well as easing family arguments. ""a typical family with two adults and two children is currently sharing a 512 kilobit service. this will basically give them 2 megabits each,"" he said.

shares in elan and biogen idec plunged on monday as the firms suspended sales of new multiple sclerosis drug tysabri after a patient's death in the us.

on the new york stock exchange, shares in ireland-based elan lost 70% while us partner biogen idec shed 43%. the firms took action after the death from a central nervous system disease and a suspected case of the condition. the cases cited involved the use of both tysabri and avonex, biogen idec's existing multiple sclerosis drug. the companies said they have no reports of the rare condition - progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (pml) - in patients taking either tysabri or avonex alone. tysabri was approved for use in the us last november and was widely tipped to become the world's leading multiple sclerosis treatment.

""the companies will work with clinical investigators to evaluate tysabri-treated patients and will consult with leading experts to better understand the possible risk of pml,"" the two firms said in a statement. ""the outcome of these evaluations will be used to determine possible re-initiation of dosing in clinical trials and future commercial availability.""

analysts had believed the product would provide a new growth opportunity for biogen idec, which had faced increased competition from rivals to avonex. elan, once the biggest firm on the irish stock exchange, was also expected to receive a boost, from the new product. an inquiry into elan's accounts in 2002 brought the group close to bankruptcy but the firm has been rebuilding itself since, with its share price increasing by almost four-fold last year. ""most of the value in the company was in tysabri,"" said ian hunter at goodbody stockbrokers in dublin. ""now there's a question mark over it."" elan finished down $18.90 at $8, while biogen fell $28.63 to $38.65.

330,"mps' murder sentence concern

murder sentences should not be reduced automatically simply because of a guilty plea, says a new mps' report.

the influential commons home affairs committee was responding to sentencing guidelines issued this summer. the mps also call for tougher sentences for crimes committed under the influence of drink or drugs. they say the influence of drugs and alcohol should be introduced as an aggravating factor when judges and magistrates sentence offenders. committee chairman john denham said drugs of alcohol were sometimes used as an excuse.

""the committee believes that these arguments should be rejected by sentencers and that being under their influence should instead be an aggravating factor."" at present judges, when sentencing murderers to the mandatory life sentence, can reduce the tariff - the minimum term they must serve - if the defendant pleads guilty. but although they are spared the ordeal of a trial many murder victims' relatives are unhappy. in july this year amanda champion's killer, james ford, pleaded guilty to her murder and was jailed for at least 15 years - it would have been longer had he denied the charge.

amanda's uncle, lewis champion, told the bbc news website ford did not deserve any credit for his plea, saying: ""nothing at all is worth taking five years off a murder sentence."" mps criticised home secretary david blunkett last year for introducing last-minute rules allowing reduced sentences for murderers who pleaded guilty.

the measures passed into law virtually unnoticed after mr blunkett introduced them at a late stage of the criminal justice bill.

as a result, says the committee, the government may need to re-legislate to ""remove ambiguity"" over how murderers should be sentenced. it is also calling on the senior judge in england and wales, lord woolf, to abandon draft guidelines he proposed in september to reduce sentences of murderers who plead guilty. the committee said the plans had not reflected the ""public disquiet"" expressed over the possibility of significantly reduced prison terms for murderers. lord woolf's sentencing guidelines council (sgc) caused further controversy by suggesting a one third discount off sentences for early guilty pleas in all types of crime. as a result murderers who face a 15-year tariff could get five years knocked off if they give themselves up to the police.

mr denham believes the sgc should reconsider its proposals to reflect parliament's wish that murder should be treated as a separate and especially grave category of offence. he said: ""we want to see sentencers advised that in the case of murder, reduction in sentence for a guilty plea should not normally be granted in addition to reductions for other mitigating circumstances."" but a spokesman for the home office defended the proposals. he said: ""by making express provision for murder tariffs in the criminal justice act, parliament sent a clear signal that it expects murder to be treated differently to other offences. ""we stand by the provisions in the act that cover guilty plea discounts, which have potential benefits for victims and witnesses of avoiding the trauma of a trial.""

shadow home secretary david davis echoed criticisms of the way mr blunkett introduced the murder tariff rules. ""there is genuine concern about potential reductions in murder sentences - such action sends out the wrong signals to violent criminals and completely undermines the government's claim to be tough on crime,"" he said. but liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten warned the mps' committee that binding judges too much might look like political interference. ""the danger of having a prescriptive approach is that whilst every murder is awful, it is also different,"" he told bbc news.

the labour party has been accused of anti-semitism over a poster depicting michael howard and oliver letwin - who are both jewish - as flying pigs.

it is one of four designs e-mailed to labour members, who were asked to vote for their favourite. mr mennear, who was sent the e-mail by a friend, said he had been ""shocked"" by the image and had shown it to friends who were similarly horrified. he said there was nothing more distasteful for a jewish person than to be associated with a pig. ""i am not suggesting there is any deliberate intent, but these sort of things can cause great offence. it clearly wasn't thought through. ""it is possible the posters were designed for maximum impact, but this one clearly overstepped the mark and should be withdrawn.""

us tobacco companies have welcomed an appeal court's decision to reject the government's $280bn (â£155bn) claim for alleged deceit about smoking dangers.

tobacco stocks rose sharply on wall street after the 2-1 decision. the court in washington found the case - filed by the clinton administration in 1999 - could not be brought under federal anti-racketeering laws. anti-smoking groups urge the government to fight on, but the justice department has not said if it will appeal. among the accused were altria group, rj reynolds tobacco, lorillard tobacco, liggett group and brown and williamson. they were delighted by the decision, which sent reynolds shares up 4.5% and altria shares up 5.11%.

charles a blixt, executive vice-president of rj reynolds tobacco, said the ruling ""dramatically transforms"" the government's lawsuit. altria group said, in a statement, the government now ""must not only prove that the companies have engaged in fraudulent behaviour in the past, but that they are likely to do so in the future.""

the government had claimed tobacco firms


 - manipulated nicotine levels to increase addiction 
 - targeted teenagers with multi-billion dollar advertising campaigns 
 - lied about the dangers of smoking and ignored research to the contrary. 
 

prosecutors wanted the cigarette firms to ""disgorge"" $280bn in profits accumulated over the past 50 years and impose tougher rules on marketing their products. they brought the case under racketeering laws, which were passed to deny mafia gangs the profits of their crimes. but the tobacco companies denied that they illegally conspired to promote smoking and defraud the public. they also said they had already met many of the government's demands in a landmark $206bn settlement reached with 46 states in 1998. the three-judge panel in the district of columbia's court of appeals ruled on friday that the us government could not sue the firms under the anti-racketeering laws. judge david sentelle, in his ruling, said such laws were aimed at putting an end to illegal conduct going forward. ""we hold that the language of (the law) and the comprehensive remedial scheme of (the law) preclude disgorgement as a possible remedy in this case,"" he wrote. the justice department refused to say if it would appeal. ""all we're saying today is that we have received the ruling and are reviewing it,"" a spokeswoman said on friday. but william corr of the campaign for tobacco-free kids urged the government to continue pressing its case. ""today's ruling should not be an excuse for this administration to seek a weak settlement that lets the tobacco industry off the hook,"" he said.

the bbc should steer away from ""demonising"" ex-downing street media chief alastair campbell, peter mandelson has said.

the european commissioner and former labour minister was speaking amid claims that mr campbell is part of a labour ""dirty tricks"" campaign. that charge was denied by mr mandelson, who said the tories were afraid of mr campbell's campaigning skills. he warned the bbc that attacking mr campbell had brought it trouble before. that was a reference to the hutton inquiry following a bbc story claiming downing street ""sexed up"" iraq's weapons of mass destruction dossier.

the affair prompted the resignation of bbc chairman gavyn davies, director-general greg dyke and reporter andrew gilligan. labour has attracted media criticism for using new freedom of information laws to dig up information about tory leader michael howard's past.

mr mandelson, a former labour communications director, told bbc radio 4's today programme: ""i understand why the tories will be gunning for alastair campbell because they fear his campaigning skills. ""what i understand less is why the bbc should be joining with the tories in driving that agenda. ""in my experience of these things, parties which shout about dirty tricks and the like tend to do so because they fear a direct hit in some vulnerable part of their political anatomy. ""i suggest the bbc concentrates on the issues and helps the public to understand the policies and the choices that are at stake in the election rather than engages in the process politics, the trivialisation of the campaign. ""i think the bbc would be much better advised to leave all this stuff well alone, concentrate on the issues as i say, not resume their demonisation of alastair campbell - we all know where that led before.""

mr campbell is acting as an adviser for labour, which denies engaging in personal campaigning. conservative co-chairman liam fox said mr campbell's return and labour poster plans attacking mr howard - recently withdrawn from the party's website - were a sign of ""abusive politics"". ""the government, despite the fact that they would say want to go forward, not back, seem intent on talking about history rather than their own record or even more importantly, about the future,"" he said on sunday. labour peer baroness kennedy, who is chairing the power inquiry into political disengagement, said people already thought politicians engaged in dirty tricks. ""this feeling of distrust is going to be enlarged if this campaigning on all sides is conducted in the way that it looks as if it just might,"" she said.

1367,"pupils to get anti-piracy lessons

lessons on music piracy and copyright issues are to be taught to secondary school pupils in the uk.

the lessons, aimed at 11 to 14-year-olds, will introduce them to copyright - including the issues of downloading from the internet and the illegal copying of cds - and its role in protecting creativity.

music piracy, including illegally swapping music online, costs the uk music industry millions every year and has been blamed for a decline in world-wide cd sales. british music rights (bmr) - which was formed to represent the interests of songwriters and composers - worked with education experts to put together a learning pack.

songwriter guy chambers, who has worked with stars including robbie williams, has thrown his support behind the scheme. he said as well as educating children about music piracy, it would also protect young people planning a career in the music industry from ""unscrupulous"" individuals. at a debate in london to launch the scheme, chambers said: ""i think it is important that young people receive practical and engaging learning in schools. ""these lessons will give them an insight into how the creative industries work which will help them in possible future careers."" the education pack, which has already been requested by more than 1,600 secondary schools, is aimed at giving children an understanding of copyright in relation to the music industry. it will also teach children about the importance of royalties and raises awareness of different careers in the music industry, particularly in the digital age.

henri yoxall, general manager of british music rights, told bbc news schools had been crying out for a resource to help them educate pupils about the issues. the scheme - which is an extension of bmr's respect the value of music campaign - is also being backed by singer-songwriters feargal sharkey, lucie silvas and grammy award-winning composer david arnold. silvas said: ""i think it is so important that students gain an understanding of how the music industry works when they are at a young age. ""i wish i had been given an opportunity like this when i was at school."" emma pike, director general of british music rights, said: ""we believe that copyright is an essential part of teaching music in schools. it is vital that the creatives of the future know how to turn their ideas into value. ""copyright education has always been important... creatives are facing more challenges and more opportunities from technological change. ""technology is allowing people to create music and distribute their music to the public in a whole host of new ways.""

373,"uk firms 'embracing e-commerce'

uk firms are embracing internet trading opportunities as never before, e-commerce minister mike o'brien says.

a government-commissioned study ranked the uk third in its world index of use of information and communication technology (ict). the report suggests 69% of uk firms are now using broadband and that 30% of micro businesses are trading online. mr o'brien said uk businesses were sprinting forward in ict use, but that there were more challenges ahead. the report, carried out independently by consultants booz allen hamilton and hi europe, placed the uk third behind sweden and ireland for business use of ict.

it showed british business brought greater maturity to their ict use, by using broadband in increased numbers, bringing ict into their business plans and using new technologies such as voice activated programmes and desktop video conferences. mr o'brien said: ""the increase in the proportion of business connected by broadband shows that uk companies are embracing the opportunities that ict can bring. ""it is particularly encouraging to see that small businesses are beginning to narrow the digital divide that appeared to have opened up in recent years."" the government would play its part in ""cultivating an environment where information and communication technologies can flourish"", mr o'brien said. the ""clear message"" the report sends is that effective use of ict can bring real improvements in business performance for all business.

""however, we are not at the finishing line yet and many challenges remain if the uk is to reach its aim of becoming a world-leading e-economy,"" he added. the international benchmarking study was based on 8,000 telephone interviews with businesses, of which more than 2,700 were uk businesses. it is the eighth in a series of examining the adoption and deployment of ict in the world's most industrialised nations.

andrew murray will become britain's youngest-ever davis cup player after it was confirmed he will play in the doubles against israel on saturday.

the 17-year-old will play alongside fellow debutant david sherwood against israel's jonathan erlich and andy ram. murray will eclipse the record set by roger becker back in 1952. greg rusedski takes tim henman's place as first choice in the singles, while alex bogdanovic will play in the second singles clash. rusedski will take on former world number 30 harel levy and bogdanovic - who has previously played in two singles rubbers against australia - will face noam okun.

murray is the brightest young hope in british tennis, after winning the us open junior title last year and the bbc young sports personality of the year. british number one tim henman, who announced his davis cup retirement earlier this year, believes britain can win the tie in tel aviv. ""it's going to be as really tough match. israel have some really good players - and their doubles pair of andy ram and jonathan erlich are among the top eight in the world - but i fancy our chances,"" he said. but henman urged bogdanovic, who has had run-ins with british tennis officials in the past, to seize his chance. ""alex is a quality player - he's young but he's got to keep pushing forward.

the uk's biggest civil service union is to ballot its 290,000 members on strikes in protest at government plans to extend their pension age to 65.

the public and commercial services union will co-ordinate any action with up to six other public sector unions. unions have already earmarked 23 march for a one-day strike which could involve up to 1.4 million uk workers. the government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made to the pension system.

pcs leader mark serwotka warned there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink.

""for a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,"" he said. ""if you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. ""in the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable."" bbc correspondent stephen cape said the combined unions represented ""a formidable force"" which could embarrass the government in the run-up to the general election. a stoppage involving civil servants, in particular, could seriously disrupt or close government departments, agencies and museums, he said.

opposition to raising the retirement age is ""one thing all the unions are agreed on"", our correspondent added. unison's 800,000 workers, the transport and general workers' union's 70,000 and amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 march walkout. deputy prime minister john prescott held a private meeting with senior union figures on thursday night. our correspondent said that he understood no deal had been offered in that meeting but that there was room for further negotiations. there was ""some possibility"" of the strike action being avoided, he added.

203,"visa row mandarin made sir john

the top civil servant at the centre of the david blunkett visa affair has been knighted in the new year honours.

sir john gieve was home office permanent secretary during the saga which ended with mr blunkett quitting. he and other civil servants were criticised for failing to recall how the visa for mr blunkett's ex-lover's nanny came to be fast-tracked. the outgoing head of the troubled child support agency doug smith also earns an honour in the new year's list. mr smith, 57, whose retirement was announced by work and pensions secretary alan smith in november, is made a commander of the order of bath.

both men were giving evidence to a commons committee on the computer difficulties facing the agency, which left thousands of single parents without any maintenance payments, when the announcement was made. the knighting of sir john, 54, will be received with astonishment by opposition politicians.

the liberal democrats said it ""beggared belief"" he and fellow officials could not remember how leoncia casalme's application for indefinite leave to remain went from mr blunkett's office to the head of the immigration and nationality department. meanwhile, the conservatives accused officials of a ""collective failure"" of memory. but sir alan budd, who led an inquiry into the affair, said he had no reason to believe anyone involved had deliberately withheld information.

downing street defended the decision to honour both men, with a spokesperson saying: ""you have to look at their whole career."" sir john was made permanent secretary in april 2001 following a civil service career which dates back to 1974. he has also worked in the treasury and the department of employment. a department for work and pensions spokeswoman said of mr smith's honour: ""the award reflects all that he has achieved in a civil service career, principally in the inland revenue, spanning over 40 years - not just his role as chief executive of the child support agency.

the us dollar hovered close to record lows against the euro on friday as concern grows about the size of the us budget deficit.

analysts predict that the dollar will remain weak in 2005 as investors worry about the state of the us economy. the bush administration's apparent unwillingness to intervene to support the dollar has caused further concern. however, trading has been volatile over the past week because of technical and automated trading and light demand. this has amplified reactions to news, analysts said, adding that they expect markets to become less jumpy in january.

the dollar was trading at $1.3652 versus the euro on friday morning after hitting a fresh record low of $1.3667 on thursday. one dollar bought 102.55 yen.

disappointing business figures from chicago triggered the us currency's weakness on thursday. the national association of purchasing management-chicago said its manufacturing index dropped to 61.2, a bigger fall than expected.

1205,"web radio takes spanish rap global

spin the radio dial in the us and you are likely to find plenty of spanish-language music. but what you will not find is much spanish-language hip-hop.

hip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the spanish-speaking world, but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. but now, a us company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. los caballeros de plan g are one of mexico's hottest hip-hop acts. they have a devoted fan base in their native monterrey. but most mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio.

""you can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in spanish... it's just not accessible,"" says manuel millan, a native of san diego, california. ""it's really hard for the spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. you usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world."" millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like los caballeros de plan g accessible to fans globally.

mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. so, millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. the name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. the site, which is in both in english and spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. all the user has to do is download a media player. there are no djs. it is just music streamed over the net for free. suddenly, with the help of the website, los caballeros de plan g are producing ""export quality"" rap.

the web might be just the right medium for spanish language hip-hop right now. the genre is in what millan calls its ""infant stage"". but the production values are improving, and artists such as argentina's mustafa yoda are pushing to make it better and better. mustafa yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. ""he's considered the eminem of argentina, and the latin american hip-hop scene,"" millan says. ""he really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the spanish-speaking world."" currently, the chilean group makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10, as is cuban artist papo record. ""every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs,"" millan says. latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. the site has listeners from across the spanish speaking world. right now, mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. but web surfers in spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station's traffic comes from there. that is not surprising as many consider spain to be the leader in spanish-language rap and hip-hop. millan says that spain is actually just behind the united states and france in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. that might be changing, though, as more and more latin american artists are finding audiences.

but one spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. his name is tote king and manuel millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in spain. on his track uno contra veinte emcees, or one against 20 emcees, tote king shows he is well aware of that fact. ""it's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in spain right now,"" millan says. ""and it's pretty much true. he has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it's amazing."" latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year. millan says they want to include more music and more news from the world of spanish language hip-hop and rap.

michael howard has backed stem cell research, saying it is important people are not frightened of the future.

the controversial issue was a feature of the recent us presidential election, where george bush opposed extending it. but the tory leader argued there was a moral case for embracing science which could help victims of alzheimer's, parkinson's and motor neurone disease. ""i believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses,"" he said. the use of embryonic stem cells in the uk is already allowed. stem cells are master cells that have the ability to develop into any of the body's tissue types. scientists hope that by growing such cells in the laboratory they can programme them to form specific tissue such as kidney, heart or even brain tissue.

mr howard acknowledged there were genuine concerns about stem cell research. but he argued: ""we mustn't be frightened of change or nostalgic about the past - we must be optimistic about the future. ""politicians must create the right framework so that the great potential of science can be harnessed for the benefit of mankind. ""with the life expectancy of the average briton now around the mid-70s, society has a responsibility to enhance the quality of people's lives as they grow older. ""i know many people are concerned about stem-cell research. they are fearful of meddling with what they see as the stuff of souls. ""i respect those concerns. but i also believe we have a duty to offer hope to the millions of people who suffer devastating illnesses like parkinson's, multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, alzheimer's and - as we saw in the papers today - now possibly heart problems.""

mr howard acknowledged there were ""no easy answers"" over such an issue but it was necessary to ""have the courage to do what we know to be morally right"". he added: ""of course, stem cells are still a recent discovery. more research needs to be done. but we must look at their potential in a responsible and grown-up way. the hopes of millions of people rest on what could be achieved."" former superman actor the late christopher reeve was an advocate for the research after he was paralysed in a horse riding accident. mr howard made his remarks during a speech in westminster to the conservative national women's committee on ambitions and values.

the national highway traffic safety administration (nhtsa) said the largest recall involves 155,465 pickups, vans and sports utility vehicles (suvs). this is because of possible malfunctions with the braking systems. the affected vehicles in the product recall are from the 2004 and 2005 model years, gm said. those vehicles with potential faults are the chevrolet avalanche, express, kodiak, silverade and suburban; the gmc savana, sierra and yukon.

the nhtsa said a pressure accumulator in the braking system could crack during normal driving and fragments could injure people if the hood was open. this could allow hydraulic fluid to leak, which could make it harder to brake or steer and could cause a crash, it warned. gm is also recalling 19,924 cadillac xlr coupes, srx suvs and pontiac grand prix sedans from the 2004 model year. this is because the accelerator pedal may not work properly in extremely cold temperatures, requiring more braking. in addition, the car giant is calling back 17,815 buick raniers, chevrolet trailblazers, gmc envoys and isuzu ascenders from the 2005 model years because the windshield is not properly fitted and could fall out in a crash. however, gm stressed that it did not know of any injuries related to the problems. news of the recall follows an announcement last month that gm expects earnings this year be lower than in 2004. the world's biggest car maker is grappling with losses in its european business, weak us sales and now a product recall. in january, gm said higher healthcare costs in north america, and lower profits at its financial services subsidiary would hurt its performance in 2005.

1719,"world leaders gather to face uncertainty

more than 2,000 business and political leaders from around the globe are arriving in the swiss mountain resort davos for the annual world economic forum (wef). for five days, they will discuss issues ranging from china's economic power to iraq's future after this sunday's elections. uk prime minister tony blair and south african president thabo mbeki are among the more than 20 government leaders and heads of state leaders attending the meeting. unlike previous years, protests against the wef are expected to be muted. anti-globalisation campaigners have called off a demonstration planned for the weekend.

the brazilian city of porto alegre will host the rival world social forum, timed to run in parallel with the wef's ritzier event in davos.

the organisers of the brazilian gathering, which brings together thousands of campaigners against globalisation, for fair trade, and many other causes, have promised to set an alternative agenda to that of the swiss summit. however, many of the issues discussed in porto alegre are davos talking points as well. ""global warming"" features particularly high. wef participants are being asked to offset the carbon emissions they cause by travelling to the event. davos itself is in deep frost. the snow is piled high across the mountain village, and at night the wind chill takes temperatures down to minus 20c and less.

ultimately, the forum will be dominated by business issues - from outsourcing to corporate leadership - with bosses of more than a fifth of the world's 500 largest companies scheduled to attend.

but much of the media focus will be on the political leaders coming to davos, not least because the agenda of this year's forum seems to lack an overarching theme. ""taking responsibility for tough choices"" is this year's official talking point, hinting at a welter of knotty problems. one thing seems sure, though: transatlantic disagreements over how to deal with iran, iraq and china are set to dominate discussions. pointedly, only one senior official from president bush's new administration is scheduled to attend. the us government may still make a conciliatory gesture, just as happened a year ago when vice president dick cheney made a surprise appearance in davos.

ukraine's new president, viktor yushchenko, is to speak, just days after his inauguration, an event that crowned the civil protests against the rigged first election that had tried to keep him from power.

the european union's top leaders, among them german chancellor gerhard schroeder and european commission president manuel barosso, will be here too. mr blair will formally open the proceedings, although his speech will be pre-empted by french president jacques chirac, who announced his attendance at the last minute and secured a slot for a ""special message"" two hours before mr blair speaks. the organisers also hope that the new palestinian leader, mahmoud abbas, will use the opportunity for talks with at least one of the three israeli deputy prime ministers coming to the event, a list that includes shimon peres. davos fans still hark back to 1994, when talks between yassir arafat and mr peres came close to a peace deal. mr blair's appearance will be keenly watched too, as political observers in the uk claim it is a calculated snub against political rival chancellor gordon brown, who was supposed to lead the uk government delegation.

microsoft founder bill gates, the world's richest man and a regular at davos, will focus on campaigning for good causes, though business interests will not be wholly absent either. having already donated billions of dollars to the fight against aids and malaria, mr gates will call on world leaders to support a global vaccination campaign to protect children in developing countries from easily preventable diseases. on tuesday, mr gates pledged $750m (â£400m) of his own money to support the cause. mr gates' company, software giant microsoft, also hopes to use davos to shore up its defences against open source software like linux, which threaten microsoft's near monopoly on computer desktops. mr gates is said to be trying to arrange a meeting with brazil's president lula da silva. the brazilian government has plans to switch all government computers from microsoft to linux. at davos, global problem solving and networking are never far apart.

chelsea boss jose mourinho has attempted to pile the pressure on title rivals arsenal ahead of the gunners facing newcastle on wednesday.

six foreign-owned textile factories have closed in lesotho, leaving 6,650 garment workers jobless, union officers told the ap news agency.

factory workers union secretary general billy macaefa blamed the closures on the end of worldwide textile quotas. the quotas for developing nations, ended on 1 january, gave them a set share of the rich countries' markets. they also limited the amount countries like china could export to the big markets of the united states and eu.

""we understand that some (owners)... were complaining that the south african rand was strong against the us dollar, and they were losing when exporting textiles and clothing to the united states,"" mr macaefa said at a news briefing in the capital, maseru. lesotho's currency, the maloti, is fixed to the rand.

the .post domain is backed by the universal postal union that wants to use it as the online marker for every type of postal service and to help co-ordinate the e-commerce efforts of national post offices.

the .travel domain would be used by hotels, travel firms, airlines, tourism offices and would help such organisations distinguish themselves online. it is backed by a new york-based trade group called the travel partnership. icann said its early decision on the two domains was in response to the detailed technical and commercial information the organisations behind the names had submitted. despite this initial approval, icann cautioned that there was no guarantee that the domains would actually go into service. at the same time icann is considering proposals for another eight domains. one that may not win approval is a proposal to set up a .xxx domain for pornographic websites. a similar proposal has been made many times in the past. but icann has been reluctant to approve it because of the difficulty of making pornographers sign up and use it. in 2000 icann approved seven other new domains that have had varying degrees of success. three of the new so-called top level domains were for specific industries or organisations such as .museum and .aero. others such as .info and .biz were intended to be more generic. in total there are in excess of 200 domain names and the majority of these are for nations. but domains that end in the .com suffix are by far the most numerous.

2103,"australia rates at four year high

australia is raising its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in four years despite signs of a slowdown in the country's economy.

the reserve bank of australia lifted interest rates 0.25% to 5.5%, their first upwards move in more than a year. however, shortly after the bank made its decision, new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter. the bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts.

the rate hike was the first since december 2003 and had been well-flagged in advance. however, opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the australian economy grew just 0.1% between october and december and 1.5% on an annual basis.

the figures, representing a decline from the 0.2% growth in gdp seen between july and september, were below market expectations. consumer spending remains strong, however, and the bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures. ""over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited,"" said ian macfarlane, governor of the reserve bank.

at 2.6%, inflation remains within the bank's 2-3% target range. however, exports declined in the second half of 2004, fuelling a rise in the country's current account deficit - the difference in the value of imports compared to exports - to a record australian dollar 29.4bn. the australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near 30 year low. ""the economy has been strong and it is properly moderating but it doesn't look to me like it's slowing in any unreasonable way,"" said treasurer peter costello. stock markets had factored in the likelihood of a rate rise but analysts still expressed concern about the strength of the economy. ""that 1.5% annual growth rate is the lowest we have seen since the post-election slump we saw back in 2000-1,"" said michael blythe, chief economist at the commonwealth bank of australia. ""this suggests the economy really did slow very sharply in the second half of 2004.""

bmw has forecast sales growth of at least 10% in asia this year after registering record sales there in 2004.

the luxury carmaker saw strong sales of its three marques - bmw, mini and rolls-royce - in asia last year after the launch of three new models. the company, which is vying with mercedes-benz for the title of leading premium carmaker, is confident about its prospects for the region in 2005. it is launching a revamped version of its 3-series saloon class next month.

bmw sold nearly 95,000 cars in asia last year, up 2.6% on 2003.

bmw-brand sales rose 2.3% to 80,600 while sales of mini models rose 3.6% to 14,800. there was also a significant increase in sales of rolls-royces on the continent. bmw sold more than 100 of the iconic models compared with just ten the previous year. the german carmaker is aiming to boost annual sales in asia to 150,000 by 2008.

873,"balco case trial date pushed back

the trial date for the bay area laboratory cooperative (balco) steroid distribution case has been postponed.

us judge susan illston pushed back a preliminary evidentiary hearing - which was due to take place on wednesday - until 6 june. no official trial date has been set but it is expected to begin in september. balco founder victor conte along with james valente, coach remy korchemny and trainer greg anderson are charged with distributing steroids to athletes.

anderson's clients include barry bonds, and several other baseball stars have been asked to appear before a congressional inquiry into steroid use in the major leagues. the balco defence team have already lost their appeal to have the case dismissed at a pre-trial hearing in san francisco but will still argue the case should not go to trial. the hearing in june will focus on the admissibility of evidence gathered during police raids on balco's offices and anderson's home. conte and anderson were not arrested at that point but federal agents did obtain statements from them. the defence are expected to challenge the legality of those interviews and if ilston agrees she could could reject all the evidence from the raids. balco has been accused by the united states anti-doping agency (usada) of being the source of the banned steroid thg and modafinil.

former double world champion kelli white and olympic relay star alvin harrison have both been banned on the basis of materials discovered during the balco investigation. britain's former european 100m champion dwain chambers is currently serving a two-year ban after testing positive for thg in an out-of-competition test in 2003. and american sprinter marion jones has filed a lawsuit for defamation against conte following his allegations that he gave her performance-enhancing drugs.

341,"top judge clashes with ministers

the uk's top judge has revealed he has clashed with ministers about how the heads of public inquiries are chosen.

lord woolf said he was determined his current veto on whether a judge should chair an inquiry should continue as a guard for judicial independence. but he told mps the lord chancellor, lord falconer, was insisting he should have the final say in such cases. lord hutton's inquiry into the death of dr david kelly sparked debate about who should run inquiries.

the government says the lord chancellor would be unlikely to go against lord woolf's wishes. lord woolf, who is lord chief justice of england and wales, was giving evidence to the commons public administration select committee's inquiry into public inquiries. he said he had not been involved in the choice of lord hutton, who as a law lord did not come under his jurisdiction. but he argued he should have a veto on whether judges generally should chair a particular inquiry and if so, which judge it should be. in written evidence to the committee, lord woolf said: ""i have, so far, failed to reach an agreement with the lord chancellor on this issue ... i intend to maintain my position and will press for this safeguard to be in any future legislation.""

judges should think carefully before heading an inquiry into a highly political issue, such as the intelligence on iraq's weapons of mass destruction, he said. he argued: ""the subject matter of the inquiry may be so political that it would be damaging to the judiciary for a judge to be involved. ""in addition, the question of whether there should be an inquiry at all may be highly controversial and if a judge is appointed, the judiciary, as a result of the appointment, may be seen as siding inappropriately with the government."" he told the mps: ""anything that tends to undermine the confidence of the public in the judiciary worries me.""

lord woolf said the current rules were not written down but it was inconceivable in practice that the lord chancellor would overrule his concerns. but that situation could change with new legal reforms. the issue had been ""overlooked"" when a new agreement was drawn up about those responsibilities and the dispute had emerged in later discussions. ""what i am asking for is a situation where if the lord chancellor cannot obtain my agreement [on appointing a judge], it doesn't happen,"" he said.

lord woolf said he did not think there would be difficulties but he wanted to establish the principle. a department for constitutional affairs spokeswoman said lord woolf and lord falconer agreed about what happened in practice. ""their disagreement is about whether the legislation should include a requirement for consultation or concurrence - a very narrow dispute, in lord woolf's words,"" she said. ""as lord woolf also acknowledged, it is highly unlikely that the lord chancellor would appoint a judge against the wishes of the lord chief justice. ""judges are free to decide for themselves whether to accept positions as inquiry chairs."" parliament will examine the issue next year when it debates a new bill about public inquiries.

1573,"top of the pops leaves bbc one

the bbc's flagship pop music programme top of the pops is to move from bbc one on fridays to sundays on bbc two.

the new programme will combine with archive show totp2, mixing new music with footage of classic bands. the corporation said the new show ""aims to appeal to a diverse audience of music lovers"". the move is the biggest shake-up in the history of the show, which was first broadcast in 1964 and has always been on bbc one. top of the pops was relaunched in a blaze of publicity in december last year in an attempt to reverse a long-term decline in audience figures.

the all new top of the pops was fronted by newcomer tim kash and was put together by producer andi peters, who was brought back to the bbc from channel 4 to revitalise the series.

about three million people a week were watching the show on fridays - less than half the total it was attracting in the mid-1990s - as the programme went up against popular itv soap coronation street. but despite the relaunch audience figures failed to rise and still remain around the three million mark. tim kash has since been replaced as host by fearne cotton. the new show will launch in spring next year in an extended format. bbc two controller roly keating: ""it's an exciting new era for top of the pops. we want to make it bigger and better so that it becomes the ultimate pop music show for music lovers of every generation."" mr keating described bbc two as the ""natural home"" of top of the pops. he added: ""the addition of top of the pops will also extend bbc two's offering to younger audiences.""

a bbc spokeswoman said andi peters would continue as executive producer on the show. she said that issues over the exact format of the programme and a time slot were still to be decided. the programme will have a close relationship with the bbc radio 1 chart show, which suggests the relaunched show may be transmitted at about 1900 on sundays. ""hopefully the audience for top of the pops will find it on bbc two. ""we think that the new slot will create a buzz around the programme as for the first time viewers will discover the news of who is number one as it happens.""

1247,"anti-spam laws bite spammer hard

the net's self-declared spam king is seeking bankruptcy protection.

scott richter, the man behind optinrealbig.com and billions of junk mail messages, said lawsuits had forced the company into chapter 11. optinrealbig was fighting several legal battles, most notably against microsoft, which is pushing for millions of dollars in damages. the company said filing for chapter 11 would help it try to resolve its legal problems but still keep trading.

listed as the third biggest spammer in the world by junk mail watchdog spamhaus, optinrealbig was sued in december 2003 for sending mail messages that violated anti-spam laws. the lawsuit was brought by microsoft and new york attorney general eliot spitzer who alleged that mr richter and his accomplices sent billions of spam messages through 514 compromised net addresses in 35 countries. according to microsoft the messages were sent via net addresses owned by the kuwait ministries of communication and finance, several korean schools, the seoul municipal boramae hospital, and the virginia community college system. mr richter settled the attorney general case in july 2004 but the legal fight with microsoft is continuing. microsoft is seeking millions in dollars in damages from optinrealbig under anti-spam laws that impose penalties for every violation. in a statement announcing the desire to seek bankruptcy protection the company said it: ""could not continue to contend with legal maneuvers (sic) by a number of companies across the country, including microsoft, and still run a viable business."" in its chapter 11 filing optinrealbig claimed it had assets of less than $10m (â£5.29m) but debts of more than $50m which included the $46m that microsoft is seeking via its lawsuit. ""the litigation has been a relentless distraction with which to contend,"" said steven richter, legal counsel for optinrealbig. ""but, make no mistake, we do expect to prevail."" for its part optinrealbig describes itself as a premier internet marketing company and said the move to seek chapter 11 was necessary to let it keep trading while sorting out its legal battles.

67,"tory leader quits legal position

david mcletchie has resigned from his post as a partner in a legal firm following criticism over his dual role.

the scottish conservative leader had insisted that his legal work with tods murray did not influence the causes he supports. but on friday he said: ""i have tendered my resignation as a partner with immediate effect."" mr mcletchie had received advice from holyrood officials about what details he needed to declare. labour said he had ""cleverly"" not asked about paid advocacy. a tory spokesman ""totally refuted"" any wrongdoing.

mr mcletchie received advice from the clerk to the standards committee after concern over him signing a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for edinburgh airport. the msp had been a partner for tods murray which has a client opposing the development. mr mcletchie did not have a complaint made against him, but when concerns were raised he sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position. he was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong.

explaining his reason for quitting the post, mr mcletchie said: ""i have been greatly concerned by the recent publicity surrounding my association with tods murray. ""however, i have no wish to see a similar situation arise again. ""to avoid any misconceptions in the future and be mindful of the good name of tods murray and the confidentiality to which its clients are entitled, i have brought forward the date of my retirement from the firm which would otherwise have happened later this year. ""i am proud to have been a part of tods murray for the last 29 years and wish it well in the future.""

labour msp christine may had said mr mcletchie was ""very clever"" to ask the clerk to consider his conduct in respect of section 5 of the code. ""he was almost bound to get the answer he wanted from this enquiry since he stands accused of breaching section 6, the section on paid advocacy,"" she said. section 5 of the members interest order legally obliges msps to declare registrable interests before taking part in related parliamentary proceedings ""where the interest would prejudice or give the appearance of prejudicing their ability to participate in a disinterested manner"". however, msps' code of conduct ""recognises a wider definition"" of parliamentary proceedings, including a non-statutory requirement to make a declaration in relation to written notices, such as motions.

but a letter from holyrood's chamber office chief ken hughes also made clear that mr mcletchie did not need to list any of the clients for whom he worked as a solicitor. commenting on mr mcletchie's decision to stand down, a scottish labour party spokesman said: ""this should mean mr mcletchie doesn't breach the paid advocacy rules in future. ""however it doesn't change the fact that there should be a full investigation into whether he has done this in the past.""

scottish national party holyrood leader nicola sturgeon accused mr mcletchie of failing to properly serve his constituents. ms sturgeon said: ""i think this whole episode has been very damaging for mr mcletchie and i'm sure he will be reflecting on it."" she added that she thought that the tories were an irrelevant party so she would not ""lose any sleep over it"". peter misselbrook, executive partner of tods murray said mr mcletchie had been considering retirement later in the year. he added: ""david has decided that this announcement should be made now and we fully understand and appreciate his reasons for doing so.""

""but i'd back us all the way to beat them when they come over."" lions boss sir clive woodward is set to announce his squad for the june-july tour next month.

when woodward was appointed last year, it was widely believed he would rely heavily on his former england players. but umaga said: ""he'd be hard pushed to do that now considering the shape of the six nations. ""don't get me wrong, england have got a lot of talented guys and i'm sure there are some of them who'll make the lions test xv. ""but you can't disguise wales and ireland in particular. some of the tries they've scored have been great. i'll admit it'll be fairly awesome lining up against the likes of brian o'driscoll.""

umaga will meet o'driscoll in saturday's rugby aid match at twickenham, with the irish captain leading the northern hemisphere side. o'driscoll is among a host of players in the northern hemisphere squad, coached by woodward, that are tipped for lions call-ups. ""it'll be good for us to get an early idea of some of these guys, although a lot can change between now and june,"" umaga said. the 31-year-old admitted interest in the lions tour was immense, calling it ""the biggest thing to hit new zealand since lord of the rings"". he added: ""as players, it's enough for us to be driven by the rarity of playing the lions. in fact, it's not just us all blacks - it's the talk of the country.""

umaga admitted the fear of injury weighed on his mind ahead of saturday's charity game, which features a host of big names including george gregan, andrew mehrtens and chris latham. but he admitted the value of the cause - proceeds of the match will go to aiding victims of the tsunami - easily won him over.

british voters would reject the european constitution by two to one, according to a poll posing the question the government will put to the country.

the daily telegraph poll suggests that 45% of people would vote against the constitution and 24% in favour. however the yougov poll, which questioned 1,943 british adults online, found 25% did not know how they would vote if forced to decide tomorrow. only 51% of those polled had made up their minds about the constitution. another 7% said they would not vote at all. the poll is believed to be the first to pose the question which the government has chosen for the upcoming referendum, expected in 2006. the constitution will be incorporated into uk law if there is a yes vote.

ballot papers in the poll will ask: ""should the united kingdom approve the treaty establishing a constitution for the european union?"" the government unveiled the question which will be asked earlier in the week.

the treaty was signed by all 25 current eu members in rome last october and is due to come into force in november 2006, providing it is ratified by all member states - several of which will hold a referendum. critics say the constitution is a further step towards a federal europe, but advocates say it ensures effective operation of the enlarged 25-state eu. ""if we reject this treaty, britain will be isolated and weak in europe,"" said foreign secretary jack straw, after the question was unveiled. mr straw, along with the rest of the cabinet, will back a ""yes"" vote. meanwhile, conservative shadow foreign secretary michael ancram said the referendum question ""seems straightforward"". but he accused the government of trying to confuse the issue by putting the eu referendum question in the same bill as the ratification of the constitution, when they should be treated as ""two separate issues"".

268,"straw backs ending china embargo

uk foreign secretary jack straw has defended plans to end the european union's arms embargo on china, despite opposition from the us and japan.

mr straw, visiting beijing, noted arms embargoes applied to china, burma and zimbabwe but not to north korea, which he said had a terrible rights record. the eu imposed its arms ban on china in 1989 after troops opened fire on protestors in tiananmen square. mr straw also signed a deal on china-uk tourism. it is expected this would increase the number of chinese tourists by 40,000 per year, providing $120m in revenue. china has in the past said it sees the weapons ban as politically driven, and does not want it lifted in order to buy more weapons. mr straw, speaking at a joint news conference with chinese foreign minister li zhaoxing, stressed this point. ""the result of any decision [to lift the arms embargo] should not be an increase in arms exports from european union member states to china, either in quantitative or qualitative terms,"" mr straw said. earlier this week he said he expected the embargo to be lifted within six months.

but mr straw faces tough opposition to the move. tory foreign affairs spokesman michael ancram said lifting the arms embargo would be ""irresponsible"" and would damage britain's relations with the us. he said mr straw was ""naive beyond belief"" if he accepted china's claim it does not want the ban lifted in order to buy weapons. the french want the embargo lifted because they want to sell arms to china; the chinese want it lifted because they want to buy arms and battlefield technology from europe."" when he was in tokyo earlier this week, japanese foreign minister nobutaka machimura told the british minister that his plan to remove the embargo was "" a worrying issue that concerns the security and environment of not only japan, but also east asia overall"". washington argues that if the embargo is lifted, it could lead to a buying spree for arms that china could use to threaten its diplomatic rival taiwan. beijing says taiwan is part of chinese territory and wants to unite it with the mainland, by force if necessary. the us is bound by law to help taiwan defend itself. washington has also voiced concern that the human rights conditions in china have not improved enough to merit an end to the embargo. it is an issue raised by human rights groups too. brad adams, from the uk's human rights watch, said: ""this is a huge political signal from europe that they are willing to forget about tiananmen square."" but mr straw insisted the eu's code of conduct on arms exports meant tough criteria on human rights still had to be met if the embargo was lifted.

1325,"mobile gaming takes off in india

gaming on the move is one of the fastest-growing activities among the tech-savvy in india, says a report.

the indian mobile gaming market is expected to generate about $26m (â£13.8m) by the end of 2004, according to market analysts in-stat/mdr. in october, mobile phone users grew by 1.4 million to 44.9 million, overtaking the number of landlines, said the telecom regulatory authority of india. analysts say cheap rates and a huge youth market is driving the market. india has a large population of under-25s, and many in urban areas are fast adopting mobiles as must-have gadgets.

india's mobile gaming market will bring in about $336m (â£178m) by 2009, according to the report. mobile gaming is expected to explode globally over the next few years. analysts predict that 220 million people will be playing games on phones by 2009, generating billions for mobile companies.

services other than just voice calls which are offered by mobile operators in india have, as a result of the huge rise in subscribers, grown significantly and rapidly. ""the growth of this market sector has attracted publishers, developers, animators, musicians, and content providers, and is also stimulating the development of innovative business models,"" said clint wheelock, director of in-stat/mdr's wireless research group.

""mobile gaming is not just about fun; it also represents one key element of a rich mobile entertainment experience for consumers, and a lucrative market opportunity for industry players."" currently, india has six big games developers and four mobile operators that offer games to their subscribers, said the report. according to in-stat/mdr, it is tipped to make up one of the most important markets in the next wave of mobile multimedia growth.

in january 2003, there were only 10 million mobile subscribers in india. many choose mobiles in rural areas in order to bypass poorer telecoms infrastructure. despite this, the penetration rate is still much lower that other countries. less than 20% of india's total population own a mobile in india, compared to well over 50% in most european countries. the trend echoes the uptake of mobiles in many developing economies, which continues to grow as people opt to leapfrog slower and more expensive state-run fixed-line operators.

the hit factory, which opened 37 years ago, has played host to some of the biggest stars in music, including paul simon, madonna and david bowie. however, the rise in digital recording has affected business at the studio, which is relocating to smaller premises in miami. lennon recorded his final album double fantasy at the studio in 1979.

1236,"broadband soars in 2004

if broadband were a jumbo jet, then 2003 would have seen it taxiing down the runway, firing up its engines and preparing for take-off. but this year has seen it soar.

in the spring it literally took to the skies as lufthansa and british airways trialled it on flights. this perhaps said more about how indispensable people were beginning to perceive the technology, rather than how useful sky-high broadband would actually be. it was flying high and by the autumn, five million britons had signed up for high-speed net access at home.

such enthusiasm is unlikely to dampen any time soon and experts predict that by the end of next year the numbers will have risen to more than eight million, or more than 30% of homes. the two key factors in whetting people's appetite were falling prices and a huge marketing push. when operators such as bt and telewest offered standard 512k broadband for less than â£20 at the beginning of the year, it was as if an invisible barrier had been breached - broadband had truly gone mass market. a feeding frenzy followed as firms vied for eyeballs in a price war reminiscent of that following the mass market take-up of dial-up. broadband for less than â£10 was even touted by some firms, although such a low price raised eyebrows among more established companies questioning how they are able to sustain such business models.

for those who became broadbanders in 2004 there was no turning back and the days of waiting for the modem to kick in began to seem as outdated an idea as a jungle without celebrities. the rest of the world was also falling in love with the benefits of fast internet access, to the tune of 100 million connections worldwide by april, prompting research firm point topic to declare it one of the fastest growing technologies ever. by september, the number of broadband connections in the uk finally overtook dial-up and in december bt announced that it was making a new broadband connection every 10 seconds.

broadband was being mentioned on the 10 o'clock news and in the tabloids; the sun even carried a cartoon joke about it. but two of the most significant pieces of news for broadband were items that did not make the headlines. in may, bt quietly announced that it was shaving 70% off the cost of allowing other operators access to its telephone exchanges, so-called local loop unbundling. the vital local loop is the crucial link between telephone exchanges and homes. at the moment bt has a stranglehold on more than 80% of these lines making it the key voice in deciding what adsl products get into homes. with cheaper local loop unbundling, rivals to bt can offer faster services that will leave the broadband of today looking positively tortoise-like. it will mean the uk will finally catch up with countries such as france and the netherlands, where homes are routinely enjoying speeds of up to 15mb (megabits per second). and the major price fall means that, rather than just talk about it, companies are actually starting to get their own equipment into bt's exchanges. it may not seem that exciting but it is a remarkable transition given that just a few years ago the arguments over local loop unbundling bore more than a passing resemblance to the northern ireland peace talks - fraught, bitter and with no end in sight.

another big piece of news for broadband users in 2004 was the extension of bt's reach, meaning more than 95% of the population could get broadband, regardless of how far away from the exchange they lived.

there was a slight caveat for those wanting to upgrade to 1mbps broadband, they still have to live within six kilometres of a broadband-enabled exchange. for thousands frustrated by their inability to get the technology, the news meant they could finally join in. broadband is not just about fast access over the telephone and cable operators ntl and telewest also had a bumper year. the biggest news for them was increased speeds, introducing 2mb and 3mb services for users and offering a free upgrade to those on 512k. the cable operators are limited in their reach and it is perhaps testament to how big a deal local loop unbundling could become that even they are considering extending their range via this route. broadband can seem confusing for consumers, with the huge amount of operators offering so many different products, some with capped bandwidth and different length contracts and set-up fees. it is unlikely to get any less easy to understand in 2005 but remains a plane worth catching. as it gets faster and offers extras such as cheap telephone calls online, the only real thing to remember for the coming year is to enjoy the ride.

the china three gorges project corp is refusing to obey a government order to stop construction of one of its giant dams, the chinese state press has said.

the builder of the three gorges dam is continuing work on the sister xiluodu dam, said the beijing news. the xiluodu dam is one of 30 such large-scale construction projects called to a halt because of a lack of proper environmental checks. the beijing news said the company may instead choose to pay a fine. the firm has also ignored orders to stop construction at two of its other projects - the three gorges underground power plant and the three gorges project electrical power supply plant.

so far, only 22 of the 30 construction projects targeted by china's state environmental protection agency (sepa) for having not carried out mandatory environmental impact assessments have complied with its shutdown order. the china three gorges project corp could now face a fine up to 200,000 yuan ($24,000; â£12,700). last week, it denied that its projects violated regulations. ""the three gorges corporation has all along abided by the law and have built our projects in accordance with the law,"" it said.

the sepa order comes as the chinese government appears to be trying to cool the country's booming economy. previously it has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages, which forced many factories into part-time working last year. in 2004, china increased its generating capacity by 12.6% to 440,700 megawatts (mw). the xiluodu dam is designed to produce 12,600 mw of electricity, and is being built on the jinshajiang - or ""river of golden sand"" as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known. it is a sister project to the main three gorges dam downstream where more than half a million people have had to be relocated, drawing criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists.

apple has unveiled a new, low-cost macintosh computer for the masses, billed as the mac mini.

chief executive steve jobs showed off the new machine at his annual macworld speech, in san francisco. the $499 macintosh, sold for â£339 in the uk, was described by jobs as the ""most important mac"" made by apple. mr jobs also unveiled the ipod shuffle, a new music player using cheaper flash memory rather than hard drives, which are used in more expensive ipods.

the new computer shifts the company into new territory - traditionally, the firm is known as a design and innovation-led firm rather than as a mass-market manufacturer. the mac mini comes without a monitor, keyboard and mouse, and a second version with a larger hard drive will also be sold for $599.

the machine - which will be available from 22 january - was described by jobs as ""byodkm... bring your own display, keyboard, and mouse"". in an attempt to win over windows pc customers, mr jobs said it would appeal to people thinking of changing operating systems. ""people who are thinking of switching will have no more excuses,"" he said. ""it's the newest and most affordable mac ever."" the new computer has been the subject of speculation for several weeks and while few people will be surprised by the announcement many analysts had already said it was a sensible move. in january, apple sued a website after it published what it said were specifications for the new computer. ian harris, deputy editor of uk magazine mac format, said the machine would appeal to pc-owning consumers who had purchased an ipod.

""they want a further taste of mac because they like what they have seen with ipod."" harris added: ""everybody thought that apple was happy to remain a niche maker of luxury computers, and moving into a market dominated by low margin manufacturers like dell is a bold move. ""but it shows that apple is keen to capitalise on the mass market success it's had with the ipod. the mac mini will appeal to pc users looking for an attractive, 'no fuss' computer."" the new ipod shuffle comes in two versions - one offering 512mb of storage for $99 (â£69 in the uk) and a second with one gigabyte of storage for $149 (â£99) - and went on sale tuesday. the music player has no display and will play songs either consecutively or shuffled. the smaller ipod will hold about 120 songs, said mr jobs. mr jobs told the delegates at macworld that ipod already had a 65% market share of all digital music players.

spain coach luis aragones is furious after being fined by the spanish football federation for his comments about thierry henry.

the 66-year-old criticised his 3000 euros (â£2,060) punishment even though it was far below the maximum penalty. ""i am not guilty, nor do i accept being judged for actions against the image of the sport,"" he said. ""i'm not a racist and i've never lacked sporting decorum. i've never done that and i have medals for sporting merit."" aragones was handed the fine on tuesday after making racist remarks about henry to arsenal team-mate and spanish international jose reyes last october.

the spanish football federation at first declined to take action against aragones, but was then requested to do so by spain's anti-violence commission. the fine was far less than the expected amount of about â£22,000 or even the suspension of his coaching licence. arsenal boss arsene wenger, who was fined â£15,000 in december for accusing manchester united striker ruud van nistelrooy of cheating, believes that aragones' punishment was too lenient. ""you compare his fine and my fine, and if you consider his was for racist abuse, then you seem to get away with it more in spain than you should,"" wenger said. ""he shouldn't have said what he said, and how much money is enough, i don't know but it doesn't look a big punishment."" however, aragones insists the fine is unjustified and unfair. ""i have been treated like islero (the bull that killed famous bullfighter manolete),"" said aragones on hearing he had been fined for his actions. ""i have not liked one thing about this whole affair and i do not agree with the sanction. they have looked for a scapegoat."" spain's anti-violence commission must now ratify the spanish fa's decision and has until next week to announce its verdict. aragones has 10 days to appeal, and the commission can also appeal. alberto flores, president of the spanish fa's disciplinary committee, said no-one in the committee felt aragones was a racist nor had ""acted in a racist way.""

199,"'errors' doomed first dome sale

the initial attempt to sell the millennium dome failed due to a catalogue of errors, a report by the government's finance watchdog says.

the report said too many parties were involved in decision-making when the attraction first went on sale after the millennium exhibition ended. the national audit office said the dome cost taxpayers â£28.7m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed. finally, a deal to turn it into a sport and entertainment venue was struck. more than â£550m could now be returned to the public sector in the wake of the deal to regenerate the site in greenwich, london.

the nao report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the dome. deputy prime minister john prescott said a good deal had been secured. ""delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the millennium village and elsewhere on the peninsula,"" he said. but edward leigh, who is chairman of the commons public accounts committee, warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the dome deal. he said: ""this report also shows that the first attempt to sell the dome proved a complete fiasco. every arm of government seems to have had a finger in the pie. the process was confused and muddled."" he added: ""four years after the millennium exhibition closed, the government finally has a deal to find a use for what has been a white elephant since it closed in a deal that, incredible as it may seem, should bring in some money and provide a benefit for the local area and the country as whole. however, it was more a question of luck that a strong bid turned up after thefirst abortive attempt."" nao head sir john bourn said: ""in difficult circumstances following the failure of the first competition, english partnerships and the office of the deputy prime minister have worked hard to get a deal.""

439,"chelsea denied by james heroics

a brave defensive display, led by keeper david james, helped manchester city hold the leaders chelsea.

after a quiet opening, james denied damien duff, jiri jarosik and mateja kezman, while paul bosvelt cleared william gallas' header off the line. robbie fowler should have scored for the visitors but sent his header wide. chelsea had most of the possession in the second half but james kept out frank lampard's free-kick and superbly tipped the same player's volley wide. city went into the game with the proud record of being the only domestic team to beat chelsea this season. and there was little to alarm them in the first 30 minutes as chelsea - deprived of arjen robben and didier drogba through injury - struggled to pose much of a threat. indeed, it was the visitors who looked likelier to enliven a drab opening played at a lethargic pace. shaun wright-phillips - watched by england boss sven-goran eriksson - showed his customary trickery to burst into the right of the area and deliver a dangerous ball, which was blocked by john terry. but chelsea suddenly stepped up a gear and created a flurry of chances. first, duff got round ben thatcher and blasted in a shot that james parried to kezman, who turned the ball wide.

soon afterwards, jarosik found space in the area to powerfully head lampard's corner goalwards but james tipped the ball over. chelsea were now looking more like premiership leaders and james kept out kezman's fierce drive before bosvelt and james combined to clear gallas' header from duff's corner. city broke swiftly up the field and the last chance of a frenetic spell should have resulted in fowler celebrating his 150th premiership goal. wright-phillips raced down the left and crossed to fowler but city's lone man up front, left free by terry's slip, contrived to head wide when it seemed a breakthrough was certain. the second half started as quietly as the first, although james was forced to divert a cross from the lively duff away from eidur gudjohnsen's path. there was a nasty moment for petr cech, looking for a ninth straight clean sheet in the league, when a series of ricochets saw fowler chase a loose ball in the area and collide accidently with the czech republic stopper. another quiet spell followed, which duff interrupted with a surging run that was halted illegally on the edge of the penalty area by bosvelt. lampard stepped up to blast a shot through the wall and james somehow blocked it with his legs. another timely challenge, this time from richard dunne in time added on, prevented gudjohnsen from getting in a shot. there was still time for james to produce a sensational save to tip lampard's volley round the post.

748,"greek duo cleared in doping case

sprinters kostas kenteris and katerina thanou have been cleared of doping offences by an independent tribunal.

the duo had been provisionally suspended by the iaaf for allegedly missing three drugs tests, including one on the eve of the athens olympics. but the greek athletics federation tribunal has overturned the bans - a decision which the iaaf can now contest at the court of arbitration for sport. the pair's former coach, christos tzekos, has been banned for four years. kenteris, 31, and thanou, 30, had been charged with avoiding drug tests in tel aviv, chicago and athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the olympics. they withdrew from the olympics after missing a drugs test at the olympic village on 12 august.

the pair then spent four days in a hospital, claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. it was the international olympic committee's demand that the iaaf investigate the affair that led to the hearing of the greek tribunal. the head of that tribunal, kostas panagopoulos, said it had not been proven that the athletes refused to take the test in athens. ""the charge cannot be substantiated,"" he said. ""in no way was he (kenteris) informed to appear for a doping test. the same goes for thanou."" kenteris's lawyer, gregory ioannidis, said: ""the decision means mr kenteris has been exonerated of highly damaging and unfounded charges which have been extremely harmful for his career.

""he has consistently maintained his innocence and this was substantiated by further evidence we were able to submit to the tribunal following its deliberations in january. ""this evidence shows mr kenteris was never asked to submit to a test by the international olympic committee so he could not possibly have been guilty of deliberately avoiding one. it shows he has no case to answer. ""mr kenteris should now be given the opportunity he deserves to rebuild his career in the full knowledge that there is no stain on his character. ""he has suffered greatly throughout this ordeal that has exposed both himself and his family to enormous pressures."" but the iaaf said it was ""very surprised"" by the verdict. spokesman nick davies said: ""we note the decision of the greek authorities with interest. ""our doping review board will now consider the english version of the decision.""

shell is to pay $1m (â£522,000) to the ex-finance chief who stepped down from her post in april 2004 after the firm over-stated its reserves.

judy boynton finally left the firm on 31 december, having spent the intervening time as a special advisor to chief executive jeroen van der veer. in january 2004, shell told shocked investors that its reserves were 20% smaller than previously thought. shell said the pay-off was in line with ms boynton's contract. she was leaving ""by mutual agreement to pursue other career opportunities"", the firm said in a statement. the severance package means she keeps long-term share options, but fails to collect on a 2003 incentive plan since the firm has failed to meet the targets included in it.

the revelation that shell had inflated its reserves led to the resignation of its chairman, sir phil watts, and production chief walter van der vijver.

an investigation commissioned by shell found that ms boynton had to share responsibility for the company's behaviour. despite receiving an email from mr van de vijver which said the firm had ""fooled"" the market about its reserves, the investigation said, she did nothing to inquire further. in all, shell restated its reserves four times during 2003. in september, it paid â£82.7m in fines to regulators on both sides of the atlantic for violating market rules in its reporting of its reserves.

the 5,808 academy voters had until tuesday afternoon to return their ballots - any late submissions will not be included in the count. the next five days will be spent counting the voting forms and preparing the winners' envelopes. best actor nominee leonardo dicaprio is to present a statuette for the first time at the la ceremony on sunday.

1215,"gta sequel is criminally good

the grand theft auto series of games have set themselves the very highest of standards in recent years, but the newest addition is more than able to live up to an increasingly grand tradition.

the 18 certificate gta: san andreas for the playstation 2 could have got away with merely revisiting a best-selling formula with a more-of-the-same approach. instead, it builds and expands almost immeasurably upon the last two games and stomps, carefree, over all the driv3r and true crime-shaped opposition. even in the year that will see sequels to halo and half-life, it is hard to envisage anything topping this barnstorming instant classic.

the basic gameplay remains familiar. you control a character, on this occasion a youth named cj, who sets out on a series of self-contained missions within a massive 3d environment. cj can commandeer any vehicle he stumbles across from a push-bike to a city bus to a plane. all come in handy as he seeks to establish his presence in a tough urban environment and avenge the dreadful deeds waged upon his family. to make things worse, he is framed for murder the moment he arrives in town, and blackmailed by crooked cops played by samuel l jackson and chris penn. the setting for all this rampant criminality is the fictional us state of san andreas, comprising three major cities: los santos, which is a thinly-disguised los angeles, san fierro, aka san francisco and las venturas, a carbon copy of las vegas. san andreas sucks you in with its sprawling range, cast of characters and incredibly sharp writing.

its ability to capture the ambience of the real-world versions of these cities is something to behold, assisted no end by the monumental graphical advances since vice city. the streets, and vast swathes of countryside, are by turns gloriously menacing, grungy and preppy. flaunting awesome levels of graphical detail, the game's overall look, particularly during the many unusual weather conditions and dramatic sunsets, is stupendous. the outstanding bread-and-butter gameplay mechanics provide a solid grounding for the elaborate plot to hang on. cars handle more convincingly than ever, a superb motion blur kicks in when you hit high speeds, and there's more traffic to navigate than before. park your vehicle across the lanes of a freeway, and within seconds there will be a huge pile-up. pedestrians are also out in force, and are a loquacious bunch. cj can interact with them using a simple system on the control pad. they will pass comments on his appearance and credibility, aspects that the player now has control over. clothes, tattoos and haircuts can all be purchased, and funding these habits can be achieved by criminal means or by indulging in mini-games like betting on horses and challenging bar patrons to games of pool. the character will put on or lose weight according to how long he spends on foot or in the gym. he will have to pause regularly in restaurants to keep energy levels up, but will swell up as a result of over-eating. and at last, this is a gta hero who can swim.

at a time when games are once again under fire for their supposed potential to corrupt the young, san andreas' violence, or specifically the freedom it gives the player to commit violence, are sure to inflame the pro-censorship brigade. developers rockstar have not shied away from brutality, and in some respects ramp it up from past outings.

when hijacking a car, for example, cj will gratuitously shove the driver's head into the steering wheel rather than just fleeing with the vehicle. indeed, the tone is darker than the jokey vice city. the grim subject matter here hardly lends itself to gags in quite the same way as the cheesy 80s setting of the last game. this title, incidentally, is set in 1992, but that is really neither here nor there apart from the influence it has on the radio playlists. the wit is still present, just more restrained than in previous outings. a further reason for this is that the incredible range of in-vehicle radio stations available means you will spend less time happening upon the hilarious talk radio options, where gta games' trademark humour is anchored. the quality of voice acting and motion capture is simply off-the-chart. the game's rather odious gangland lowlifes swagger and mouth off in a way that rings very true indeed. it is a testament to san andreas' magnificence that it has a number of prominent flaws, but plus-points are so numerous that the niggles don't detract. the on-screen map, for instance, is needlessly fiddly, an unwelcome change from past editions. there is also a very jarring slowdown at action-packed moments. and the game suffers from the age-old problem that can be relied upon to blight all games of this genre, setting you back a vast distance when you fail right at the very end of a long mission. but the gameplay experience in its entirety is overwhelmingly positive. you simply will not be bothered by these minor failings. san andreas is among the few unmissable games of 2004.

marcel desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when chelsea take on barcelona on wednesday.

the french star was part of the chelsea side crushed 5-1 at the nou camp in the champions league quarter-final second leg in 2000. ""things will be totally different this time,"" he told bbc sport. ""now everyone knows about chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them. they are one of the major clubs in europe and the pressure will be on barcelona."" chelsea have not played barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. the blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at stamford bridge 3-1, courtesy of two goals from tore andre flo and one by gianfranco zola. but they collapsed in the second leg, going down to strikes from rivaldo (2), luis figo, dani and patrick kluivert.

former chelsea captain desailly, who is now playing for al-gharafa in qatar, says there is no comparison between that side and the current blues team, who are top of the premiership. ""mentally they are much stronger, even though a lot of their players are young,"" the 36-year-old said. ""we made some mistakes at the nou camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes. ""it would not happen now. this team has a new motivation and a different mentality."" world cup winner desailly saw huge changes during his time at stamford bridge. he was signed for â£4.6m from ac milan in 1998 by ruud gullit and went on to play under gianluca vialli and claudio ranieri. but the biggest change occurred when billionaire roman abramovich bought the club in 2003. desailly says the russian's arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. ""the whole of chelsea is different now - the chairman, the manager and all the players,"" he said.

""everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. ""since that game in 2000, chelsea have gained more experience in europe and were very close to reaching the champions league final last season."" desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. he won the 1998 world cup and 2000 european championship with france, the champions league in 1993 with marseilles and 1994 with ac milan, two serie a titles and the fa cup in 2000 with chelsea.

he is now winding down his career in qatar, alongside the likes of frank lebeouf, josep guardiola, titi camara, gabriel batistuta and christophe dugarry. so he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against manchester united on wednesday - paolo maldini and alessandro costacurta.

959,"new consoles promise big problems

making games for future consoles will require more graphic artists and more money, an industry conference has been told.

sony, microsoft and nintendo will debut their new consoles at the annual e3 games expo in los angeles in may. these so-called ""next generation"" machines will be faster than current consoles, and capable of displaying much higher-quality visuals. for gamers, this should make for better, more immersive games. in a pre-recorded video slot during microsoft's keynote address at the game developers conference, held last week in san francisco, famed director james cameron revealed he is making a game in tandem with his next film - believed to be battle angel alita. the game's visual quality would be ""like a lucid dream,"" said mr cameron. but numerous speakers warned that creating such graphics will require more artists, and so next generation console games will be much more expensive to develop. the first new console, microsoft's xbox 2, is not expected to reach the shops until the end of 2005. games typically take at least 18 months to create, however, so developers are grappling with the hardware today.

according to robert walsh, head of brisbane-based game developer krome studios, next generation games will cost between $10-25m to make, with teams averaging 80 staff in size taking two years to complete a title. such sums mean it will be difficult for anyone to start a new game studio, said mr walsh. ""if you're a start-up, i doubt that a publisher is going to walk in and give you a cheque for $10m, however good you are,"" he said. mr walsh suggested that new studios should make games for mobile phones and handheld consoles like the sony psp and the nintendo ds, since they are cheaper and easier to create than console games.

one developer bucking the trend towards big art teams is will wright, the creator of the best-selling the sims games. the founder of california's maxis studio surprised the conference with a world exclusive preview of his next game, spore. spore will allow players to experiment with the evolution of digital creatures. starting with an amoeba-sized organism, the player will guide the physical development of their creature by selecting how its limbs, jaws and other body parts evolve.

eventually the creature will become capable of establishing cities, trading and fighting, and even building space ships. advanced players will visit the home planets of creatures created by other spore players. these worlds will be automatically swapped across the internet. mr wright said that enabling players to devise and share their creatures would make them care more about the game. ""i don't want to put the player in the role of luke skywalker or frodo baggins - i want them to be george lucas or dr seuss,"" explained mr wright. few games have hinted at the scope of spore, but mr wright explained that he has nevertheless kept his development team small by hiring expert programmers. instead of employing lots of artists to create 3d models of the digital creatures, spore generates and displays the creatures according to rules devised by the programmers. ""the thing i am coming away with [from the conference] is that next generation content is going to be really expensive, and creating it will drive the smaller players out of the market,"" said mr wright. ""i'd like to offer an alternative to that.""

new development tools will be another important aid in making next generation games, and dozens of companies demonstrated their latest products at the conference.

oxford-based natural motion launched endorphin v2.0, which enables artists to direct a 3d 'virtual actor'. the actor is realistically modelled according to the laws of physics. endorphin simulates how the actor falls down stairs, for instance, or crumples up after a gunshot. artists can blend together these visual sequences, and include the results in their games. the process is much quicker than having an artist animate each movement by hand, and so lessens the need for larger art teams. another british company aiming to reduce the workload of artists is manchester start-up genemation. its latest tool, gencrowd, enables artists to create unique, photo-realistic human faces for games involving lots of people. gencrowd works by blending together elements of an in-built supply of stock faces of differing ages and ethnicities. the software can create up to 2,000 new heads an hour.

one area not yet dominated by graphical blockbusters is mobile phone games. even the latest phones are not as powerful as the consoles of a decade ago, so smaller teams of half a dozen people can still create complete games for the devices.

the game developers conference included a special two-day summit dedicated to creating mobile games. a niche attraction for a few dozen conference attendees when it began five years ago, gdc's mobile summit this year drew several hundred delegates. mobile games are a fast-growing sector because newer phones have better graphics and sound, and are thus more suitable for playing games. furthermore, the adoption of mobile phones continues to spread across the world. it's predicted that by 2006 two billion people will own a mobile phone. the growing importance of mobile gaming was reflected by a keynote given by john batter, general manager at ea mobile. ea mobile is a division of electronic arts, the biggest games publisher. until recently electronic arts had been dismissive of games for phones. ""the last time you checked, ea wasn't in this business,"" mr batter admitted. but he said ea now planned on dominating the market by releasing mobile versions of its most popular franchises. ea plans to release up to 20 mobile games over the next 12 months. the first will be a version of its need for speed racing game, created by ea mobile's 30-person development team. mr batter predicted that by 2006, mobile phones would be capable of running games of comparable quality to those on sony's upcoming psp handheld console.

1092,"first look at playstation 3 chip

some details of the chip inside sony's playstation 3 have been revealed.

sony, ibm and toshiba have released limited data about the so-called cell chip that will be able to carry out trillions of calculations per second. the chip will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together. the playstation 3 is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch.

the three firms have been working on the chip since 2001 but before now few details have been released about how it might function. in a joint statement the three firms gave hints about how the chip will work but fuller details will be released in february next year at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco.

the three firms claim that the cell chip will be up to 10 times more powerful than existing processors. when put inside powerful computer servers, the cell consortium expects it to be capable of handling 16 trillion floating point operations, or calculations, every second. the chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media. ibm said it would start producing the chip in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the us. the first machines off the line using the cell processor will be computer workstations and servers. a working version of the ps3 is due to be shown off in may 2005 but a full launch of the next generation console is not expected to start until 2006. as well as being inside the playstation 3, the chip will also be used inside high-definition tvs and powerful computers. ""in the future, all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network,"" said ken kutaragi, chief operating officer of sony. ""current pc architecture is nearing its limits.""

the movie industry has struck out at file-sharing networks with another round of lawsuits in the us.

the motion picture association of america (mpaa) also said it had succeeded in getting a network called lokitorrent closed down. it is the latest network which uses the peer-to-peer system called bittorrent to be hit by the mpaa. the mpaa began its legal campaign against operators of similar networks across four continents in december. a dallas court agreed that hollywood lawyers would be allowed access to lokitorrent's server records which could let them single out those who were sharing files illegally. in october 2004, the site had provided links to more than 30,000 files. the action came after the operators of lokitorrent agreed a settlement with the mpaa. a stark message has appeared on the site from the mpaa warning ""you can click, but you can't hide"". in bittorrent systems, server sites do not host the files being shared. they host links, called ""trackers"" that direct people to others that have it instead.

as well as filing an unspecified number of file suits across the us, the mpaa said it had given operators that host edonkey servers ""take down"" notices. hollywood studios are aggressively clamping down on file-sharers who it says infringe copyright laws by copying films and tv programmes then share the files online. but it is now targeting the operators of bittorrent networks themselves. it has filed 100 lawsuits against operators of bittorrent server sites since december. the strategy of hitting those who run the servers which link to copyrighted material is intended to stunt file-sharers' ability to swap content using bittorrent systems. the film industry says the black market for illegally copied videos and dvds already costs them billions every year and it is worried that illegal file-sharing is adding to their losses. in december, the legal action claimed its most high-profile victim. the popular suprnova.org website was forced to close, and others like phoenix torrent followed soon after.

343,"terror suspects face house arrest

uk citizens suspected of involvement in terrorism could face house arrest as part of a series of new measures outlined by the home secretary.

it comes after law lords ruled that the detention of 12 foreign terror suspects without trial breached human rights. charles clarke's planned ""control orders"" mean anyone suspected of being involved in terrorism could be subject to house arrest, curfews or tagging. the law society dubbed mr clarke's new proposals an ""abuse of power"". deals are already being sought to deport some of the foreign detainees who are mainly held in belmarsh prison in london under the current laws introduced after the us terror attacks on 11 september 2001. mr clarke said efforts would continue to deport them to their countries of origin algeria, tunisia, egypt and jordan without them facing torture or death.

under the proposed changes - prompted by the house of lords ruling - the home secretary could order british citizens or foreign suspects who could not be deported, to face house arrest or other measures such as restrictions on their movements or limits on their use of telephones and the internet.

british citizens are being included in the changes after the law lords said the current powers were discriminatory because they could only be used on foreign suspects. mr clarke also said intelligence reports showed some british nationals were now playing a more significant role in terror threats. human rights lawyer clive stafford-smith said the plans were a ""further abuse of human rights in britain"".

mr clarke said prosecutions were the government's first preference and promised the powers would only be used in ""serious"" cases, with independent scrutiny from judges.

he told mps: ""there remains a public emergency threatening the life of the nation."" he accepted the law lords' ruling but argued detention powers had helped prevent attacks and deter terrorists. the current detainees would not be freed until the new powers were in place as they were still considered a national security threat, he told mps.

there have been calls for the rules for wire-tap and intercept evidence to be allowed to be used in courts but mr clarke refused to back that change.

he said intercept evidence was only a small part of the case against the men and some of it could not be used because it could put sources' lives at risk. most of the terror suspects are being held indefinitely at belmarsh prison, in london. conservative shadow home secretary david davis was worried about extending special powers to cover british citizens. he warned: ""throughout history, internment has generally backfired because of the resentment it creates. ""so unless the process is clearly just, the home secretary could find himself confining one known terrorist only to recruit 10 unknown terrorists."" he suggested changing the law to let security-cleared judges view evidence gathered by phone-tapping could allow more terror cases to come to court.

liberal democrat spokesman mark oaten also backed use of wire-tap evidence. he said the standard of proof for the new powers would have to be ""very high indeed"" and he asked whether ministers had looked at measures which fitted with human rights laws. shami chakrabarti, from human rights group liberty, joined calls for intercept evidence to be allowed in trials. she said: ""adherence to the rule of law should not be a game of cat and mouse. the government should not swap one human rights 'opt out' for another.""

with its hand-animated sprites and 2d side-scrolling, this was even considered retro when released in arcades four years ago. but a more frantic shooter you will not find at the end of your joypad this year. and yes, that includes halo 2. simply choose your grunt and wade through five 2d side-scrolling levels of the most hectic video game blasting you will ever encounter. it is also the toughest game you are likely to play, as hordes of enemies and few lives pile the pressure on.

players must battle soldiers, snowmen, zombies, giant crabs and aliens, not to mention the huge, screen-filling bosses that guard each of the five levels.

the shoot-anything-that-moves gameplay is peppered with moments of old-school genius. fans of robotic gastropods should note the title refers, instead, to the vast array of vehicles on offer in a game stuffed with bizarre hardware. tanks, jets and submarines can be commandeered, as well as cannon-toting camels, elephants and ostriches - more weaponry on offer than in an acre of iraq. doling out justice is a joy thanks to ultra responsive controls, and while this is a tough nut to crack, it is addictive enough to have you gagging for that one last go. and at a mere â£20, metal slug 3 is as cheap as sliced, fried spuds, as the man says. of course, most of you will ignore this, lacking as it does the visual fireworks of modern blasters. but at a time when blockbuster titles offer only a fresh lick of paint in favour of real innovation, metal slug 3 is a fresh gasp of air from an era when the xbox was not even a twinkle in bill gates' eye.

1565,"dj double act revamp chart show

dj duo jk and joel are taking over bbc radio 1's flagship chart show on sunday, adding showbiz news, celebrity interviews and between-song banter.

they hope to boost ratings for the long-running show, which has been overtaken in popularity by independent radio's hit 40 uk rundown. ""radio 1's chart show is an institution and remains the station's single most popular show,"" says jk, also known as jason king. ""for years people have been tuning in at four o'clock with their tape recorders ready to record their favourite tunes. not that i ever did that. ""but things have moved on a lot now so it was time for a change.""

that change involved ejecting previous host wes butters and relocating king and dj partner joel ross from their weekend afternoon radio 1 slot. the pair have worked together for a decade - meeting on viking radio in hull before moving to manchester station key 103 and winning two sony radio awards. they also presented gadget series playboyz and car show motor maniacs for cable tv channel granada men and motors, and pure soap on bbc three.

on the revamped chart show their cheeky, laddish banter will punctuate star interviews and competitions, film and dvd charts plus a look at future single releases, in addition to the singles chart itself. ""the chart rundown is no longer the only point of the programme,"" says ross. ""the show used to be the only way to discover who was in the top 40. now you can just click on the internet to find that out, so the show has plenty of extra items too."" the show's reduced reliance upon the top 40 also reflects the fact that music fans are now more likely to download songs in digital format rather than buy them on compact disc, vinyl or cassette.

""i personally buy downloads rather than cd singles,"" says 27-year-old ross. ""even my grandma can download songs now. jk is still struggling with the technology, though."" ""but it's premature for people to say that the singles chart is dead,"" ross adds. ""while sales of singles on traditional formats are down, interest in songs has been revived by download sales, which will be incorporated into our main chart rundown from april. ""music fans still want to know what is the most popular song of the week.""

ross will be plumping for chart success from rapper verbalicious and the stereophonics on sunday, while king is more of an r&b and dance music fan. ""so listeners will get the advantage of both our music tastes,"" says king, 30, who describes outgoing host butters as ""an extremely professional and competent broadcaster"".

""the advantage joel and i have is that we're a double act, with a rapport between us that makes the show much more interactive,"" king says. ""wes has a great broadcasting career ahead of him. and if not, i could always use a cleaner,"" he jokes. ross says the pair have done their best to ignore the weight of expectation placed upon the revamped show. ""other people can worry about that, we are going to continue doing what we do well,"" he says. ""at the end of the day this is a radio show that is meant to be entertaining. nobody died.""

sony, ibm and toshiba, who have been working on the cell processor for three years, will unveil the chip at a technology conference. the chip is reported to be up to 10 times faster than current processors. it is being designed for use in graphics workstations, the new playstation console, and has been described as a supercomputer on a chip. sony has said the cell processor could be used to bridge the gap between movies and video games. special effects and graphics designed for films could be ported for use directly in a video game, sony told an audience at the e3 exhibition in los angeles last year.

cell could also be marketed as an ideal technology for televisions and supercomputers, and everything in between, said kevin krewell, the editor in chief of microprocessor report. the chip will be made of several different processing cores that work on tasks together. the playstation 3 is expected in 2006 but developers are expecting to get prototypes early next year to tune games that will appear on it at launch. details of the chip will be released at the international solid state circuits conference in san francisco. some details have already emerged, however. when put inside powerful computer servers, the cell consortium expects it to be capable of handling 16 trillion floating point operations, or calculations, every second.

the chip has also been refined to be able to handle the detailed graphics common in games and the data demands of films and broadband media. ibm said it would start producing the chip in early 2005 at manufacturing plants in the us. the first machines off the line using the cell processor will be computer workstations and servers. a working version of the ps3 is due to be shown off in may 2005 but a full launch of the next generation console is not expected to start until 2006. ""in the future, all forms of digital content will be converged and fused onto the broadband network,"" said ken kutaragi, chief operating officer of sony, said last year. ""current pc architecture is nearing its limits,"" he added.

501,"o'driscoll saves irish blushes

two moments of magic from brian o'driscoll guided ireland to a workmanlike victory against italy.

a pair of classic outside breaks from the ireland captain set up tries for geordan murphy and peter stringer. italy led 9-8 early in the second half but stringer's try gave ireland a lead they never lost. the hosts cut the gap to 18-12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through ludovico nitoglia, but denis hickie's try ensured an irish victory. italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through a luciano orquera penalty after seven minutes.

it could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and ireland drew level with a ronan o'gara penalty midway through the first half. the italians were driving at the heart of the irish defence and, for the first quarter, the irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs.

when they finally did, just before the half-hour mark, o'driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for murphy. the ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the full-back and putting the diving murphy in at the corner. o'gara missed the twice-taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again. roland de marigny took over the kicking duties for italy from the hapless orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge italy into a 9-8 lead.

the only ireland player offering a real threat was o'driscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors. shane horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and stringer scooted over, with o'gara landing the tricky conversion. a penalty apiece saw ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter, but they were lucky to survive when italy launched a series of attacks. winger nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul.

an o'gara penalty put ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when hickie latched onto an inside pass from murphy and crossed for a converted try. o'driscoll limped off late on, joining centre partner gordon d'arcy on the sidelines, and the final word went to italy. prop martin castrogiovanni powered over for a try which was fitting reward for an italian pack which had kept the irish under pressure throughout.

japanese communications firm softbank has widened losses after heavy spending on a new cut-rate phone service.

the service, launched in december and dubbed ""otoku"" or ""bargain"", has had almost 900,000 orders, softbank said. the firm, a market leader in high-speed internet, had an operating loss for the three months to december of 7.5bn yen ($71.5m; â£38.4m). but without the otoku marketing spend it would have made a profit - and expects to move into the black in 2006. the firm did not give a figure for the extent of profits it expected to make next year. it was born in the 1990s tech boom, investing widely and becoming a fast-rising star, till the end of the tech bubble hit it hard. its recent return to a high profile came with the purchase of japan telecom, the country's third-biggest fixed-line telecoms firm. the acquisition spurred its broadband internet division to pole position in the japanese market, with more than 5.1 million subscribers at the end of december.

hiding women away in the home hidden behind veils is a backward view of islam, president musharraf of pakistan has said during a visit to britain.

he was speaking to the bbc's newsnight programme a few hours before visiting the pakistani community in manchester. ""my wife is travelling around. she is very religious but she is very moderate,"" said general musharraf. it comes after pakistan's high commissioner to britain said some pakistanis should integrate more. dr maleeha lodhi said people could not expect others to listen to their grievances if they isolated themselves.

gen musharraf told the bbc: ""some people think that the women should be confined to their houses and put veils on and all that and they should not move out - absolutely wrong."" the pakistani president was also asked whether he thought the war on terror had made the world less safe. ""yes, absolutely. and i would add that unfortunately we are not addressing the core problems, so therefore we can never address it in its totality,"" he said. ""we are fighting it in its immediate context but we are not fighting it in its strategic long-term context.

""it is the political disputes and we need to resolve them, and also the issue of illiteracy and poverty. this combined are breeding grounds of extremism and terrorism."" on monday the pakistani president met prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street, on his first official visit to london. he is due to visit the pakistani community in manchester on tuesday afternoon.

the mirror newspaper said on tuesday it had been handed a sensitive dossier outling the details of gen musharraf's visit to britain. the paper said the document had been found in a london street by a member of the public. it said the dossier contained details about his movements and also confidential police radio channels, call signs and codes. speaking in london on monday, gen musharraf said al-qaeda was ""on the run"" in pakistan.

but standing next to mr blair he added that it was crucial to tackle the ""core of what creates terrorists, what creates an extremist, militant environment which then leads on to terrorism"". ""that is the resolution of political disputes.""

mr blair said the two leaders had talked about afghanistan, the wider war on terror, the situation in the middle east and the ongoing dispute over kashmir. ""we agreed that in afghanistan there is some cause for optimism about the progress that has been made there,"" said mr blair. ""in respect of iraq, we agreed that whatever the issues of the past, the important thing now is to see the strategy through and ensure that iraq is capable of becoming a stable and democratic state.""

90,"tories attack burglar 'u-turns'

tory leader michael howard has accused tony blair of performing u-turns over rules on using force against burglars.

the government has ruled out amending the present law, which allows ""reasonable force"" in self defence. mr howard branded the decision unacceptable, saying: ""it is not householders who should be frightened, it's the burglars."" home secretary charles clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law.

metropolitan police commissioner sir john stevens last month backed a tory attempt to change the law so only householders using ""grossly disproportionate"" force could be prosecuted. the pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and crown prosecution service would be consulted as part of a review of the law. he told mps: ""if we get the right response from those people, we will, of course, support a change in the law."" instead, the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves. on thursday, mr howard told bbc radio 4's today programme mr blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again. he said: ""we've had three policy positions in three months and two u-turns. ""it's not surprising gordon brown told him: 'there's nothing you could say to me now that i could ever believe.'""

mr howard said the ""grossly disproportionate"" test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders. the issue entered the public spotlight when norfolk farmer tony martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16-year-old burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm. but the home secretary said mr howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars. the barrister who had represented mr martin had said the rules were ""weighted overwhelmingly"" in favour of the householder, said mr clarke. he said: ""the problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point sir john stevens was making and the prime minister was making."" the new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue, added mr clarke. the director of public prosecutions, ken macdonald, says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar, tied him up, beat him and set him alight, he said. tory mp patrick mercer's private member's bill to change the law received a first reading in parliament on wednesday and goes to a full debate next month.

1888,"beijingers fume over parking fees

choking traffic jams in beijing are prompting officials to look at reorganising car parking charges.

car ownership has risen fast in recent years, and there are now two and a half million cars on the city's roads. the trouble is that the high status of car ownership is matched by expensive fees at indoor car parks, making motorists reluctant to use them. instead roads are being clogged by drivers circling in search of a cheaper outdoor option. ""the price differences between indoor and outdoor lots are unreasonable,"" said wang yan, an official from the beijing municipal commission for development and reform quoted in the state-run china daily newspaper. mr wang, who is in charge of collecting car parking fees, said his team would be looking at adjusting parking prices to close the gap. indoor parking bays can cost up to 250% more than outdoor ones.

sports fans who drive to matches may also find themselves the target of the commission's road rage. it wants them to use public transport, and is considering jacking up the prices of car parks near sports grounds. mr wang said his review team may scrap the relatively cheap hourly fee near such places and impose a higher flat rate during matches. indoor parking may be costly, but it is not always secure. mr wang's team are also going to look into complaints from residents about poor service received in exchange for compulsory monthly fees of up to 400 yuan ($48; â£26). the beijing authorities decided two years ago that visiting foreign dignitaries' motorcades should not longer get motorcycle outriders as they blocked the traffic. unclogging beijing's increasingly impassable streets is a major concern for the chinese authorities, who are building dozens of new roads to create a showcase modern city ahead of the 2008 olympic games.

782,"newcastle 27-27 gloucester

newcastle centre mathew tait answered his critics as he scored one try and made another, but he could not stop gloucester grabbing a draw.

the falcons were 22-6 down at the break before tait, recently axed by england after just one six nations outing, inspired his side to a 27-22 lead. a last-gasp touchdown from luke narraway pulled the visitors level. but gloucester missed out on victory when henry paul fluffed the conversion and seti kiole was denied a late try. newcastle had a couple of chances at the start of the second half with line-outs in the corner. but they failed to make them count until joe shaw found dave walder, who released mark mayerholfer in his own 22.

the former all black broke clear and popped the ball up for tait on halfway. he chipped ahead for michael stephenson to scorch through for the try, which walder converted to give newcastle a lifeline. they grabbed it with both hands, mayerhofler breaking through and tait making a brilliant early run to cut inside and race 30m to score. walder converted to make it 22-20 before he was just wide with a 40m penalty in the 70th minute.

mayerhofler then scythed through the middle for a try after hall charlton popped the ball up, and walder's conversion took newcastle 27-22 ahead. with three minutes of normal time left, narraway was driven over for a try in the corner which levelled the scores at 27-27. henry missed the conversion but gloucester nearly won it when kiole broke through only to be hauled down by charlton and tom may.

707,"radcliffe proves doubters wrong

this won't go down as one of the greatest marathons of paula's career. but as a test of character, it was the toughest race she's ever taken part in.

a win in the new york marathon doesn't make up for the disappointment of athens in any shape or form, but it will offer hope and reassurance for next year. if paula's last experience of the year had been athens, it would have been very difficult to look forward with any optimism. she can now draw a line under this year and make plans about her future. even if she'd lost this race, there would have been a lot of positives to take out of it. she knows she can dig deep if she needs to. it was a strong field, with a number of the girls going into the race with expectations of winning. and although two hours 23 minutes wasn't one of paula's best times, it wasn't far off the record on a difficult course.

i was speaking to paula in the lead-up to this race and she said that in many ways she was facing a no-win situation. she thought that if she won, people would say ""why couldn't she do that in athens?"" and if she lost, people would say her career was over. and a lot of people were wondering what would happen if paula was forced to drop out of this race, as she did in the marathon and 10,000m in athens. but that was never on the cards. she might have been beaten, but she would have kept running. the reasons she was forced to pull out in athens - the niggling injuries, her lack of energy and the oppressive conditions - weren't at play here. the only question was what position she could finish in. most important of all, despite all the hype in the media ahead of this race, there were never doubts in paula's mind. if she wasn't confident, she wouldn't have run. after all, if you're the best in the world at an event, you'll always have expectations of winning.

now paula will take part in the run london 10km race in london at the end of the year, have a well-earned rest over christmas and go into next year with a lot of optimism.

43,"lords wrong on detainees - straw

jack straw has attacked the decision by britain's highest court that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws.

the foreign secretary said the right to life was the ""most important liberty"" and the government had a duty to protect people from terrorism. law lords were ""simply wrong"" to imply the men were being held arbitrarily. new home secretary charles clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed.

the house of lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men - dealing a major blow to the government's anti-terror policy.

but mr straw denied it amounted to a ""constitutional crisis"". he said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court. ""the law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary,"" he told bbc radio 4's today programme. the foreign secretary insisted it was for parliament, and not judges, to decide how best britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism. but liberal democrat peer lord carlile, the government's independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released. he said the law lords' ruling was an ""embarrassment"" for the government and major changes were needed to the law.

the ruling came on charles clarke's first day as home secretary following david blunkett's resignation. in a statement to mps, mr clarke said: ""i will be asking parliament to renew this legislation in the new year.

""in the meantime, we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the house of lords."" the detainees took their case to the house of lords after the court of appeal backed the home office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. the government opted out of part of the european convention on human rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 september attacks in the us. any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. but those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. on thursday, lord bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the european convention on human rights as they allowed detentions ""in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status"" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not britons. lord nicholls of birkenhead, in his ruling, said: ""indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.

in a statement, detainee 'a' in woodhill prison said: ""i hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones."" the case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. solicitor gareth pierce, who represents eight of the detainees, claimed the detention had driven four of the detainees to ""madness"", saying two were being held in broadmoor hospital.

1018,"rings of steel combat net attacks

gambling is hugely popular, especially with tech-savvy criminals.

many extortionists are targeting net-based betting firms and threatening to cripple their websites with deluges of data unless a ransom is paid. but now deep defences are being put in place by some of the uk's biggest net firms to stop these attacks. increasing numbers of attacks and the huge amounts of data being used to try to bump a site off the web are prompting firms to adopt the measures. ""net firms are realising that it's not just about anti-virus and firewalls,"" said paul king, chief security architect at cisco. ""there are more things that can be done in the network to protect data centres."" mr king said the only way to properly combat these so-called distributed denial-of-service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems. many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting, said mr king. this overspill effect was only likely to grow as attacks grow in size and scale.

malcolm seagrave, security expert at energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time. bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen, he said. ""it does feel like they are turning the dial because you see this traffic gradually growing,"" he said.

so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data, said mr seagrave. however, he added that it was only a matter of time before such large attacks were mounted. maria capella, spokeswoman for net provider pipex, said that when ddos attacks were at their height, customers were getting hit every four to five days. the defences being put in place constantly monitor the streams of data flowing across networks and pluck out the traffic destined for target sites. ""it's about understanding what's genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site,"" she said. ""we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that's when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack,"" said ms capella. this traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood.

typically these computers have been infected by a virus or worm which reports its success and the net address of compromised machines back to the malicious hacker or hi-tech criminal that set off the virus. hijacked computers are known as zombies or 'bots and collections of them are called 'bot nets. many spammers rent out 'bot nets to help them anonymously send junk mail.

most of the zombies are based outside the country that hosts the target site so getting the attacking pcs shut off can be difficult. often pipex and other net suppliers do get advance notice that an attack is about to happen. ""the serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail,"" said ms capella. ""we ask, as part of the service we provide, that customers notify us of anything they have in advance that would give us forewarning."" once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up. energis took a similar approach, said mr seagrave. ""we have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together,"" said mr seagrave. also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from. information gathered on attacks and where they originated has led to some arrests. he said energis also did its own intelligence work to get in insight into which sites criminal gangs plan to target.

","so far there have been no attacks involving gigabytes of data, said mr seagrave.many of the gambling sites suffering ddos attacks are in offshore data and hosting centres, so any large scale data flood could knock out access to many more sites than just the one the criminals were targeting, said mr king.""it's about understanding what's genuine traffic and keeping attack traffic from going to the site,"" she said.malcolm seagrave, security expert at energis, said the most common types of attacks hit sites with 10 megabytes of data over short periods of time.once an attack is spotted dedicated net hardware takes over to remove the attack traffic and ensure that sites stay up.bigger attacks sending down 200 megabytes of traffic or more were rarely seen, he said.maria capella, spokeswoman for net provider pipex, said that when ddos attacks were at their height, customers were getting hit every four to five days.""we have technology out there that allows us to detect attacks in minutes rather than let network engineers spend hours pulling the information together,"" said mr seagrave.mr king said the only way to properly combat these so-called distributed denial-of-service attacks was with intelligent net-based systems.""the serious players tend to precede an attack with some kind of ransom e-mail,"" said ms capella.""we study the profile of their traffic and as soon as we see an anomaly in the profile that's when we start to get the backbone engineering boys to see if we are going to sustain an attack,"" said ms capella.""you can see them going alphabetically through the list with the gambling sites, trying one after another,"" said mr seagrave.this traffic can be hard to spot because ddos attacks typically use thousands of computers in many different countries, each participating machine only sends a small part of the entire data flood.also net firms were starting to work more closely together on the problem of ddos attacks and pool information about where they are coming from.",tech,727,325

955,"apple attacked over sources row

civil liberties group the electronic frontier foundation (eff) has joined a legal fight between three us online journalists and apple.

apple wants the reporters to reveal 20 sources used for stories which leaked information about forthcoming products, including the mac mini. the eff, representing the reporters, has asked california's superior court to stop apple pursuing the sources. it argues that the journalists are protected by the american constitution. the eff says the case threatens the basic freedoms of the press.

apple is particularly keen to find the source for information about an unreleased product code-named asteroid and has asked the journalists' e-mail providers to hand over communications relevant to that. ""rather than confronting the issue of reporter's privilege head-on, apple is going to the journalist's isps for his e-mails,"" said eff lawyer kurt opsahl. ""this undermines a fundamental first amendment right that protects all reporters. ""if the court lets apple get away with this, and exposes the confidences gained by these reporters, potential confidential sources will be deterred from providing information to the media and the public will lose a vital outlet for independent news, analysis and commentary,"" he said. the case began in december 2004 when apple asked a local californian court to get the journalists to reveal their sources for articles published on websites appleinsider.com and powerpage.org.

apple also sent requested information from the nfox.com, the internet service provider of powerpage's publisher jason o-grady. as well as looking at how far corporations can go in preventing information from being published, the case will also examine whether online journalists have the same privileges and protections as those writing for newspapers and magazines. the eff has gained some powerful allies in its legal battle with apple, including professor tom goldstein, former dean of the journalism school at the university of california and dan gillmor, a well-known silicon valley journalist. apple was not immediately available for comment.

1878,"asian quake hits european shares

shares in europe's leading reinsurers and travel firms have fallen as the scale of the damage wrought by tsunamis across south asia has become apparent.

more than 23,000 people have been killed following a massive underwater earthquake and many of the worst hit areas are popular tourist destinations. reisurance firms such as swiss re and munich re lost value as investors worried about rebuilding costs. but the disaster has little impact on stock markets in the us and asia.

currencies including the thai baht and indonesian rupiah weakened as analysts warned that economic growth may slow. ""it came at the worst possible time,"" said hans goetti, a singapore-based fund manager. ""the impact on the tourist industry is pretty devastating, especially in thailand."" travel-related shares dropped in europe, with companies such as germany's tui and lufthansa and france's club mediterranne sliding. insurers and reinsurance firms were also under pressure in europe.

shares in munich re and swiss re - the world's two biggest reinsurers - both fell 1.7% as the market speculated about the cost of rebuilding in asia. zurich financial, allianz and axa also suffered a decline in value.

however, their losses were much smaller, reflecting the market's view that reinsurers were likely to pick up the bulk of the costs. worries about the size of insurance liabilities dragged european shares down, although the impact was exacerbated by light post-christmas trading. germany's benchmark dax index closed the day 16.29 points lower at 3.817.69 while france's cac index of leading shares fell 5.07 points to 3.817.69. investors pointed out, however, that declines probably would be industry specific, with the travel and insurance firms hit hardest. ""it's still too early for concrete damage figures,"" swiss re's spokesman floiran woest told associated press. ""that also has to do with the fact that the damage is very widely spread geographically.""

the unfolding scale of the disaster in south asia had little immediate impact on us shares, however. the dow jones index had risen 20.54 points, or 0.2%, to 10,847.66 by late morning as analsyts were cheered by more encouraging reports from retailers about post-christmas sales. in asian markets, adjustments were made quickly to account for lower earnings and the cost of repairs. thai airways shed almost 4%. the country relies on tourism for about 6% of its total economy. singapore airlines dropped 2.6%. about 5% of singapore's annual gross domestic product (gdp) comes from tourism. malaysia's budget airline, airasia fell 2.9%. resort operator tanco holdings slumped 5%.

travel companies also took a hit, with japan's kinki nippon sliding 1.5% and his dropping 3.3%. however, the overall impact on asia's largest stock market, japan's nikkei, was slight. shares fell just 0.03%. concerns about the strength of economic growth going forward weighed on the currency markets. the indonesian rupiah lost as much as 0.6% against the us dollar, before bouncing back slightly to trade at 9,300. the thai baht lost 0.3% against the us currency, trading at 39.10. in india, where more than 2,000 people are thought to have died, the rupee shed 0.1% against the dollar analysts said that it was difficult to predict the total cost of the disaster and warned that share prices and currencies would come under increasing pressure as the bills mounted.

an ex-chief financial officer at boeing has received a four-month jail sentence and a fine of $250,000 (â£131,961) for illegally hiring a top air force aide.

michael sears admitted his guilt in breaking conflict of interest laws by recruiting darleen druyun while she still handled military contracts. ms druyun is currently serving a nine month sentence for favouring boeing when awarding lucrative contracts. boeing lost a $23bn government contract after a pentagon inquiry into the case. the contract, to provide refuelling tankers for the us air force, was cancelled last year.

the pentagon revealed earlier this week that it would examine eight other contracts worth $3bn which it believes may have been tainted by ms druyun's role in the procurement process. boeing sacked mr sears and ms druyun in november 2003 after allegations that they had violated company recruitment policy. ms druyun had talks with mr sears in october 2002 about working for boeing, while she was still a top procurement official within the pentagon. she subsequently joined the company in january 2003. ms druyun admitted that she had steered multi-billion dollar contracts to boeing and other favoured companies.

in documents filed in a virginia court ahead of mr sears' sentencing, prosecutors blamed boeing's senior management for failing to ask key questions about the ""legal and ethical issues"" surrounding ms druyun's appointment. mr sears told prosecutors that no other boeing officials were aware that ms druyun was still responsible for major procurement decisions at the time she was discussing a job with boeing. however, analysts believe boeing may yet face civil charges arising from the scandal. the pentagon has investigated 400 contracts, dating back to 1993, since the allegations against ms druyun came to light.

boeing's corporate ethics have come under scrutiny on several occasions in recent years. boeing was sued by lockheed martin after its rival accused it of industrial espionage during a 1998 contract competition. boeing apologised publicly for the affair - although it claimed it did not gain any unfair advantage - and pledged to improve its procedures. the pentagon subsequently revoked $1bn worth of contracts assigned to boeing and prohibited the seattle-based company from future rocket work.

microsoft says it is clamping down on people running pirated versions of its windows operating system by restricting their access to security features.

the windows genuine advantage scheme means people will have to prove their software is genuine from mid-2005. it will still allow those with unauthorised copies to get some crucial security fixes via automatic updates, but their options would be ""limited"". microsoft releases regular security updates to its software to protect pcs. either pcs detect updates automatically or users manually download fixes through microsoft's site. those running pirated windows programs would not have access to other downloads and ""add-ons"" that the software giant offers.

people who try to manually download security patches will have to let microsoft run an automated checking procedure on their computer or give an identification number.

microsoft's regular patches which it releases for newly-found security flaws are important because they stop worms, viruses and other threats penetrating pcs. some security experts are concerned that restricting access to such patches could mean a rise in such attacks and threats, with more pcs left unprotected. but graham cluley, senior consultant at security firm sophos, told the bbc news website that it was a positive decision. ""it sounds like their decision to allow critical security patches to remain available to both legitimate and illegitimate users of windows is good news for everyone who uses the net,"" he said. windows genuine advantage was first introduced as a pilot scheme in september 2004 for english-language versions of windows.

microsoft's windows operating system is heavily exploited by virus writers because it is so widespread and they are constantly seeking out new security loopholes to take advantage of. the company is trying to tackle security threats whilst cracking down on pirated software at the same time. software piracy has cost the company billions, it says. the company announced earlier in january that it was releasing security tools to clean up pcs harbouring viruses and spyware, which 90% of pcs are infected with. the virus-fighting program, updated monthly, is a precursor to microsoft's dedicated anti-virus software. last year it introduced the windows xp counterfeit project, a uk-based pilot scheme, which ran from november to december. the scheme meant that anyone with pre-installed copies of the operating system in pcs bought before november could replace counterfeit versions of windows xp with legal ones for free. it is also increasing efforts to squash software piracy in china, norway and the czech republic, where pirated software is a huge problem, by offering discounts on legitimate software to users of pirated copies windows. ""china in particular is a problem, with piracy estimated at 92%,"" said mr cluley.

l'esquive earned a cesar prize for its director, tunisian-born abdellatif kechiche, and its young star, the 18-year-old actress sara forestier. it saw off competition from big-budget french epic, a very long engagement, and the box-office hit, the chorus. us film lost in translation won the award for best foreign feature. the wistful romantic comedy directed by sofia coppola has already won several awards, including an oscar for best screenplay in 2004. its late release in france made it a contender for this year's cesars.

the low-budget l'esquive depicts the travails of a group of youth getting ready to perform a school play by the 18th-century dramatist, marivaux. the actors are mostly amateurs and the action is set in the impoverished suburbs of paris, home to thousands of immigrants from north africa and their children. kechiche said he made the film because he ""wanted to show people we don't normally see at the cinema"". a very long engagement, a world war i drama featuring audrey tautou, won five cesar awards. the chorus, a film about a schoolteacher who introduces an unruly classroom to the pleasures of classical singing, won two awards - for best music and best sound. us actor will smith, who won an honorary award at the ceremony, thanked his family and his ""hero"", nelson mandela, in his speech.

1483,"famed music director viotti dies

conductor marcello viotti, director of venice's famous la fenice theatre, has died in germany at 50.

viotti, director of la fenice since 2002, conducted at renowned opera houses worldwide including milan's la scala and the vienna state opera. his time at la fenice coincided with its reopening in 2003 after it was destroyed by fire in 1996. he fell into a coma after suffering a stroke during rehearsals for jules massenet's manon last week.

he conducted some of the best orchestras in the world including the berlin philharmonic and the english chamber orchestra. viotti was born in switzerland and studied the piano, cello and singing at the lausanne conservatory. his career breakthrough came in 1982 when he won first prize at the gino marinuzzi conducting competition in italy. viotti established himself as chief conductor of the turin opera and went on to become chief conductor of munich's radio orchestra. at la fenice viotti was widely acclaimed for his production of the french composer massenet's thais and some of his other productions included giuseppe verdi's la traviata and richard strauss's ariadne auf naxos.

the last opera he directed at la fenice was massenet's le roi de lahore. viotti's debut at the new york's metropolitan opera came in 2000 with giacomo puccini's madame butterfly, followed by la boheme, la traviata and fromental halevy's la juive. giampaolo vianello, superintendent of the fenice theatre foundation, said: ""i am filled with extreme sadness because, other than a great artist, he is missed as a friend - a main character in the latest joyous times, during the rebirth of our theatre."" viotti's last public performance was on 5 february when he conducted vincenzo bellini's norma at the vienna state opera.

1927,"uk 'risks breaking golden rule'

the uk government will have to raise taxes or rein in spending if it wants to avoid breaking its ""golden rule"", a report suggests.

the rule states that the government can borrow cash only to invest, and not to finance its spending projects. the national institute of economic and social research (niesr) claims that taxes need to rise by about â£10bn if state finances are to be put in order. the treasury said its plans were on track and funded until 2008. according to niesr, if the government's current economic cycle runs until march 2006 then it is ""unlikely"" the golden rule will be met. should the cycle end a year earlier, then the chances improve to ""50/50"". either way, fiscal tightening is needed, niesr said.

the report is the latest to call into question the viability of government spending projections. earlier this month, accountancy firm ernst & young said that chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown's forecasts for tax revenues were too optimistic.

it claimed revenues were likely to be â£6bn below estimates by the end of the tax year despite the economy growing in line with forecasts. a treasury spokesperson dismissed the latest claims, saying it was ""on track to meeting spending rules and the golden rule in the current cycle and beyond"". ""spending plans have been set out until 2008 and they are fully affordable."" other than its warning on possible tax hikes, the niesr report was optimistic about the state of the uk and global economy.

it said the recent record-busting surge in oil prices would have a limited effect on worldwide expansion, saying that if anything the ""world economy will continue to grow strongly"". global gross domestic product (gdp) is tipped to be 4.1% this year, dipping to 4% in 2005, before picking up again to 4.2% in 2006. the us will continue to drive expansion until 2006, albeit at a slightly slower rate, as will be the case in japan. hinting at better times for uk exporters, niesr said the euro zone ""is expected to pick up speed"".

growth in britain also is set to accelerate, it forecast. ""despite weak growth in the third quarter, the forces sustaining the upswing remain intact and the economy will expand robustly in 2005 and 2006,"" niesr said, adding that ""the economy will become better balanced over the next two years as exports stage a recovery"". gdp is expected at 3.2% in 2004, and 2.8% in both 2005 and 2006. the main cloud on the horizon, niesr said, was the uk's much analysed and fretted over property market.

1923,"news corp makes $5.4bn fox offer

news corporation is seeking to buy out minority investors in fox entertainment group, its broadcasting subsidiary, for about $5.4bn (â£3.7bn).

the media giant, run by rupert murdoch, owns 82% of the shares in the company, home to the fox television network and the 20th century fox film studio. the move follows news corp's decision to register its business in the us. 20th century fox's recent film releases include i heart huckabees and i, robot, while fox puts out hit tv series 24.

under the terms of the offer, minority fox shareholders will receive 1.90 news corp shares in return for each fox share they hold. analysts said the decision to list news corp in the us - which will result in the firm's shares trading in new york rather than sydney- nullified the need to retain a separate stock market listing for fox entertainment shares. news corp investors voted in october to approve the transfer of the company's corporate domicile from australia to the us state of delaware. the move is designed to help news corp attract more investment from the largest us financial institutions, and make it easier to raise capital. fox entertainment group generated revenues of $12bn last year. news corp shares fell 25 cents to $17.65 after the share offer was announced while fox shares were up 19 cents at $31.22.

1631,"the sound of music is coming home

the original stage production of the sound of music is to be performed for the first time in the austrian capital, 40 years after the film was released.

the first full-scale theatrical production of the musical will make its debut in vienna on saturday. julie andrews starred in the 1965 film version of the rogers and hammerstein classic set in the alpine country. but despite being one of the most successful musicals of all time, it is barely known inside austria.

the film was never shown in any cinema in austria and was not broadcast on television until the early 1990s. the musical is based on the true story of the von trapp family who formed a singing troupe and escaped from nazi-occupied austria in 1938.

sensitivities about nazism during wartime austria and issues towards the von trapp family themselves could explain austria's reluctance to embrace the musical. another source of irritation for austrians is the song edelweiss, which is considered an traditional folk song by many filmgoers. the song was actually an invention by rodgers and hammerstein. many also consider the film to portray a kitsch image of austria, including yodelling, goat-herds and lederhosen. the production is being staged at a viennese opera house, the volksoper, beginning on saturday. maria, the novice nun who falls in love with baron von trapp, will be played by austro-australian actress and singer sandra pires.

494,"hewitt survives nalbandian epic

home favourite lleyton hewitt came through a dramatic five-set battle with argentine david nalbandian to reach the australian open semi-finals.

hewitt looked to be cruising to victory after racing into a two-set lead. but nalbandian broke his serve three times in both of the next two sets to set up a nailbiting decider. hewitt eventually grabbed the vital break in the 17th game and served out to win 6-3 6-2 1-6 3-6 10-8 and set up a meeting with andy roddick. the winner of that match will face either roger federer or marat safin in the final. ninth seed nalbandian had never come back from two sets down to win a match, and there was no indication he would do so as hewitt dominated the first two sets.

the argentine had stoked up the temperature ahead of the match by saying hewitt's exuberant on-court celebrations were ""not very good for the sport"". and he had words with hewitt during one change of ends in the second set when the australian appeared to brush shoulders with him as they went to their chairs. the balance of power changed completely in the third set as hewitt allowed his level to dip, and he double-faulted twice as nalbandian broke on the way to taking the fourth set. but the tiring third seed showed incredible reserves of strength to force the break despite being outplayed for much of the final set and three times coming within two points of defeat. he then produced a love service game to finish off the match in four hours and five minutes. ""i just kept hanging in there. it was always tough serving second in the fifth set,"" said hewitt, who had never reached the last four at his home grand slam. ""i told myself to give everything and in the end it paid off once again. ""it's a long way from holding that trophy up there but i'm hanging in there. ""only four guys left that can win and we're the top four in the world. it's set up for a pretty good showdown in the semis and finals.""

2207,"venezuela and china sign oil deal

venezuelan president hugo chavez has offered china wide-ranging access to the country's oil reserves.

the offer, made as part of a trade deal between the two countries, will allow china to operate oil fields in venezuela and invest in new refineries. venezuela has also offered to supply 120,000 barrels of fuel oil a month to china. venezuela - the world's fifth largest oil exporter - sells about 60% of its output to the united states. mr chavez's administration, which has a strained relationship with the us, is trying to diversify sales to reduce its dependence on its largest export market.

china's quick-growing economy's need for oil has contributed to record-high oil prices this year, along with political unrest in the middle east and supply bottlenecks. oil prices are finishing the year roughly 30% higher than they were in january 2004.

in 2004, according to forecasts from the ministry of commerce, china's oil imports will be 110m tons, up 21% on the previous year. china has been a net importer of oil since the mid 1990's with more than a third of the oil and gas it consumes coming from abroad. a lack of sufficient domestic production and the need to lessen its dependence on imports from the middle east has meant that china is looking to invest in other potential markets such as latin america. mr chavez, who is visiting china, said his country would put its many of its oil facilities at the disposal of china. chinese firms would be allowed to operate 15 mature oil fields in the east of venezuela, which could produce more than one billion barrels, he confirmed. the two countries will also continue a joint venture agreement to produce stocks of the boiler fuel orimulsion. mr chavez has also invited chinese firms to bid for gas exploration contracts which his government will offer next year in the western gulf of venezuela. the two countries also signed a number of other agreements covering other industries including mining.

980,"'brainwave' cap controls computer

a team of us researchers has shown that controlling devices with the brain is a step closer.

four people, two of them partly paralysed wheelchair users, successfully moved a computer cursor while wearing a cap with 64 electrodes. previous research has shown that monkeys can control a computer with electrodes implanted into their brain. the new york team reported their findings in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences. ""the results show that people can learn to use scalp-recorded electroencephalogram rhythms to control rapid and accurate movement of a cursor in two directions,"" said jonathan wolpaw and dennis mcfarlane. the research team, from new york state department of health and state university of new york in albany, said the research was another step towards people controlling wheelchairs or other electronic devices by thought.

the four people faced a large video screen wearing a special cap which, meant no surgery or implantation was needed.

brain activity produces electrical signals that can be read by electrodes. complex algorithms then translate those signals into instructions to direct the computer. such brain activity does not require the use of any nerves of muscles, so people with stroke or spinal cord injuries could use the cap effectively. ""the impressive non-invasive multidimensional control achieved in the present study suggests that a non-invasive brain control interface could support clinically useful operation of a robotic arm, a motorised wheelchair or a neuroprosthesis,"" said the researchers. the four volunteers also showed that they could get better at controlling the cursor the more times they tried. although the two partially-paralysed people performed better overall, the researchers said this could be because their brains were more used to adapting or that they were simply more motivated. it is not the first time researchers have had this sort of success in brain-control experiments. some teams have used eye motion and other recording techniques. earlier this year, a team at the mit media labs europe demonstrated a wireless cap which read brain waves to control a computer character.

your computer can now help solve the world's most difficult health and social problems.

launched this week, the world community grid will use idle computer time to test solutions to these problems. the donated processor cycles will help the wcg create virtual supercomputers via the net. the idea follows the success of other similar projects that have used the untapped processing power of millions of desktop pcs. one of the most successful collaboration projects was seti@home, run by the search for extra terrestrial life project, which sorted through radio signals looking for signs of alien communication.

anyone can volunteer to donate the spare time of their computers by downloading a special screensaver from the wgc website. once installed, the virtual terminal gets a chunk of the computational task to process, and reports back after completing that task. the first wcg problem being tackled will be the human proteome folding project, which hopes to identify the ways that the proteins in our body fold.

the subjects of study are being selected by an international advisory board of experts specializing in health sciences, and technology. the body will evaluate proposals from leading research, public and not-for-profit organizations, and is expected to oversee up to six projects a year. organisations also represented on the board include the united nations development programme and the world health organisation.

66,"uk troops on ivory coast standby

downing street has confirmed british troops are on standby in case they need to help evacuate several hundred uk citizens from ivory coast.

the news came as it emerged france had begun evacuating its hostages after days of anti-french demonstrations. trouble flared after nine french peacekeepers were killed and president jacques chirac ordered the destruction of the ivory coast's air force. a company of 100-120 uk troops is understood to have been put on standby. they are ready to fly out and secure the route from the embassy to the airport if called upon. prime minister tony blair's official spokesman said: ""there are british nationals in ivory coast and as you can imagine we are making the usual contingency plans in case the situation deteriorates further, but that's all i can say at this stage.""

he added the situation would be monitored carefully in case evacuation became necessary. france has played a lead role in international peacekeeping in ivory coast - a former colony - after president laurent gbagbo broke an 18-month ceasefire with rebels bombing their positions and killing the nine french soldiers. the decision to destroy the african nation's small air force prompted riots against french and other foreign nationals. the spanish have already put their forces on standby to evacuate their nationals if necessary.

2077,"boeing unveils new 777 aircraft

us aircraft firm boeing has unveiled its new long-distance 777 plane, as it tries to regain its position as the industry's leading manufacturer.

the 777-200lr will be capable of flying almost 11,000 miles non-stop, linking cities such as london and sydney. boeing, in contrast to european rival airbus, hopes airlines will want to fly smaller aircraft over longer distances. airbus, which overtook boeing as the number one civilian planemaker in 2003, is focusing on so-called super jumbos.

analysts are divided over which approach is best and say that this latest tussle between boeing and airbus may prove to be a defining moment for the airline industry. boeing plans to offer twin-engine planes that are able to fly direct to many of the world's airports, getting rid of the need for connecting flights.

it is banking on smaller, slimmer planes such as the 777-200lr and its much-anticipated 787 dreamliner plane, which is set to take to the skies in 2008. the 777-200lr, which had its launch delayed by the 11 september attacks in the us, is the fifth variation of boeing's twin-aisle 777 plane. the company offically ""rolled-out"" the new 777 in seattle at 2200 gmt. better fuel efficiency from engines made by ge and lighter materials mean that the plane can connect almost any two cities worldwide.

""boeing has the latest variant in a very successful line of airplanes and there is no doubt it will continue to be very successful,"" said david learmount, operations and safety editor at industry magazine flight international. but the 777-200lr ""is a niche player"", mr learmount continued, adding that reach was not the only criteria airlines used when picking their aircraft. mr learmount pointed out that the 777-200lr has been on the market for a couple of years and only had limited success at attracting orders. he also said that while the plane may be able to fly to sydney from london in one hit, prevailing winds meant that it would have to stop somewhere on the return journey.

for airbus, the future is big - it is pinning its hopes on planes that can carry as many as 840 people between large hub airports. from there, passengers would be ferried to their final destinations by smaller planes. airbus is also keeping its options open and plans to compete in all the main categories of aircraft. it has been producing a rival to boeing's 777 line for more than a year. ""airbus is now where boeing was a few years ago"" with its product range, said flight international's mr learmount.

both boeing and airbus have been taking orders for their new planes. boeing said it expected to sell about 500 of its 777-200lr planes over the next 20 years. it already has orders from pakistan international airlines and eva of taiwan. these orders should help underpin the company's profits. boeing said earnings during the last three months of 2004 dropped by 84% because of costs relating to stopping production of its smallest airliner, the 717, and the cancellation of a us air force 767 tanker contract. net profit was $186m (â£98m; 143m euros) in the quarter, compared with $1.13bn in the same period in 2003.

new owner yeahronimo media ventures has not ruled out the possibility of a new breed of commodore computers. it also plans to develop a ""worldwide entertainment concept"" with the brand, although details are not yet known. the groundbreaking commodore 64 computer elicits fond memories for those who owned one back in the 1980s.

in the chronology of home computing, commodore was one of the pioneers.

the commodore 64, launched in 1982, was one of the first affordable home pcs. it was followed a few years later by the amiga. the commodore 64 sold more than any other single computer system, even to this day. the brand languished somewhat in the 1990s. commodore international filed for bankruptcy in 1994 and was sold to dutch firm tulip computers. in the late 1980s the firm was a great rival to atari, which produced its own range of home computers and is now a brand of video games, formerly known as infogrames.

tulip computers sold several products under the commodore name, including portable usb storage devices and digital music players. it had planned to relaunch the brand, following an upsurge of nostalgia for 1980s-era games. commodore 64 enthusiasts have written emulators for windows pc, apple mac and even pdas so that the original commodore games can be still run. the sale of commodore is expected to be complete in three weeks in a deal worth over â£17m.

2165,"uk firm faces venezuelan land row

venezuelan authorities have said they will seize land owned by a british company as part of president chavez's agrarian reform programme.

officials in cojedes state said on friday that farmland owned by a subsidiary of the vestey group would be taken and used to settle poor farmers. the government is cracking down on so-called latifundios, or large rural estates, which it says are lying idle. the vestey group said it had not been informed of any planned seizure.

the firm, whose agroflora subsidiary operates 13 farms in venezuela, insisted that it had complied fully with venezuelan law. prosecutors in the south of the country have targeted hato el charcote, a beef cattle ranch owned by agroflora. according to reuters, they plan to seize 12,900 acres (5,200 hectares) from the 32,000 acre (13,000 hectare) farm.

officials claim that agroflora does not possess valid documents proving its ownership of the land in question. they also allege that areas of the ranch are not being used for any form of active production. ""the legal boundaries did not match up with the actual boundaries and there is surplus,"" state prosecutor alexis ortiz told reuters. ""as a consequence the government has taken action.""

controversial reforms passed in 2001 give the government the right to take control of private property if it is declared idle or ownership cannot be traced back to the 19th century.

critics say the powers - which president chavez argues are needed to help the country's poorest citizens and develop the venezuelan economy - trample all over private property rights. the vestey group said it had owned the land since 1920 and would co-operate fully with the authorities. but a spokesman added: ""agroflora is absolutely confident that what it has submitted will demonstrate the legality of its title to the land."" the company pointed out that the farm, which employs 300 workers, provides meat solely for the venezuelan market.

last month, the government said it had identified more than 500 idle farms and had yet to consider the status of a further 40,000. the authorities said landowners whose titles were in order and whose farms were productive had ""nothing to fear"". under president chavez, the venezuelan government has steadily expanded the state's involvement in the country's economy. it recently said all mining contracts involving foreign firms would be examined to ensure they provided sufficient economic benefits to the state.

australian airline qantas has posted a record fiscal first-half profit thanks to cost-cutting measures.

net profit in the six months ending 31 december rose 28% to a$458.4m ($357.6m; â£191m) from a year earlier. analysts expected a figure closer to a$431m. qantas shares fell almost 3%, however, after it warned that earnings growth would slow in the second half. sales will dip by at least a$30m after the indian ocean tsunami devastated many holiday destinations, qantas said.

""the tsunami affected travel patterns in ways that we were a bit surprised about,"" chief executive geoff dixon explained. ""it certainly affected japanese travel into australia. as soon as the tsunami hit we saw ... a lessening with bookings for australia."" higher fuel costs also are expected to eat into earnings in coming months.

even so, the firm is predicting that full-year earnings will increase from the previous 12 months. analysts have forecast full-year profit will rise about 11% to around a$720 million ($563 million). qantas boss mr dixon also said he would be reviewing the group's cost-cutting measures. during the first six months of the fiscal year, qantas made savings of a$245m, and is on track to top its target of a$500m for the full year. last month, the company warned it may transfer as many as 7,000 jobs out australia, with mr dixon quoted as saying that the carrier could no longer afford to remain ""all-australian"".

the manchester-based production is called touching from a distance, after a book by curtis's widow deborah which forms the basis for the film. music mogul tony wilson, who headed the record company joy division were signed to, will be co-executive producer. the musician committed suicide in 1980 aged 23, shortly before the band were due to go on tour in the us. mr wilson, who has remained friends with curtis's widow and daughter natalie, who he says asked for his involvement to make the film ""official"". ""people have different ideas as to why ian committed suicide, so maybe the film will reflect those different views,"" he told the bbc news website.

65,"new rules tackle 'sham weddings'

new rules on marriage for foreign nationals living in the uk are coming into force.

from tuesday, most non-eu citizens will need home office approval to marry. the home office says the new rules are aimed at reducing the number of sham marriages, of which there are estimated to be up to 15,000 a year. but immigrants' group the joint council for the welfare of immigrants (jcwi) says the rules breach human rights law and it may mount a legal challenge. when the changes were unveiled last year, immigration minister des browne said: ""our aim is to avoid unnecessary disruption of genuine marriages, while providing firm controls to prevent abuse."" under the previous regulations anybody wishing to get married in the uk only had to produce evidence they had been resident in the country for a week and give 15 days notice of the wedding at the local register office.

but from tuesday all non-eu nationals, apart from citizens of switzerland, liechtenstein, iceland or norway, intending to wed in the uk must either obtain a visa allowing them to get married before they enter the country or apply for a home office 'certificate of marriage approval'. to get a certificate, costing â£135, applicants will have to send proof that they have a legal right to be in the uk. those without a settled status, such as asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their application, will have no right to marry in the uk.

once they have the necessary documentation, those subject to immigration controls wishing to get married in england or wales must register their intention to marry at one of 76 specially-designated register offices. they can, however, marry at the register office or church of their choice. rhian beynon of the jcwi said the new rules were ""not proportionate"" and ""discriminatory"".

""these rules means in some cases the home secretary is going to be a marriage registrar of last resort. ""we're currently taking a legal opinion on this. we'll be looking for people whose right to marry is breached and we'll be looking at taking a case on this to the human rights court,"" ms beynon said. the new rules have also been called into question by the parliamentary joint committee on human rights. in a report published last july the cross-party committee stated there was a ""significant risk"" the new procedures were incompatible with the right to marry because they introduced restrictions which were ""disproportionate"". the committee believed the new laws might be incompatible with the human rights act on the grounds of religion, belief and nationality, the report added.

over the last year immigration service operations against marriages of convenience have been stepped up resulting in a growing number of convictions. in january 25 people who took part in a sham marriage network based in leicester were jailed for a total of 35 years. and last november samuel amoah, a belgian national who set up two sham weddings for couples who wanted to remain in the uk, was jailed for three years. several other cases are currently going through the courts. the role of registrars who under the asylum and immigration act 1999 were obliged to report suspected sham marriages to the home office, has been key in many prosecutions. registrars' spokesman, mark rimmer, said they welcomed the new marriage regulations and believed they would be an significant deterrent. ""they will effectively remove most of the blatant cases. certainly those who are illegals in this country, of which we had quite a few, will no longer be getting married,"" mr rimmer said. mr rimmer, the service director for registrations of marriages at brent council in north-west london, said he did not consider the new law to be an infringement of civil liberties. ""it may be seen to be far more draconian than it has been but certainly it's still not as difficult to marry in the uk than it is to marry, for example, in holland, germany or france. ""i think it's a proportionate response by government to what was a very large problem,"" mr rimmer said.

1256,"ds aims to touch gamers

the mobile gaming industry is set to explode in 2005 with a number of high-profile devices offering a range of gaming and other features such as movie and music playback. market leader nintendo, however, is releasing a handheld console that it says will revolutionise the way games are played.

the first striking thing about the ds is how retro it looks. far from looking like a mould-breaking handheld, it looks more like nintendo dug out a mould from a 1980s handheld prototype. the lightweight clam shell device opens up to reveal two screens, and when switched on it instantly reveals its pedigree. both screens are crisp and clear while the bottom of the two is touch sensitive. nintendo has given developers free rein to utilise the dual screens and ability to control the action by simply touching the screen.

the japanese gaming giant hopes the ds will maintain the firm's pre-eminence in an increasingly-competitive mobile gaming market.

nintendo first launched its gameboy console in 1989 and has dominated the market ever since. but its lead can no longer be taken for granted. sony will enter the market later this year with its playstation portable, while start-up companies gizmondo and tapwave zodiac are also offering hybrid devices. ""we believe the ds will appeal to all ages, both genders and gamers of any skill,"" said david yarnton, nintendo europe's general manager said at the recent press launch for the handheld. with its two screens, wireless connectivity and backwards compatibility with the gameboy advance, the ds certainly has a number of unique selling points. it went on sale in the us in mid-november priced $150 and nintendo says sales have exceeded expectations, without giving detailed figures. japan and europe will have to wait until the first quarter of 2005 to get the device. with more than two million pre-orders for the device in japan, nintendo is confident it will keep its number one spot. but will the device prove to be as revolutionary as claimed? the game ships with a demo of metroid hunters - a 3d action title which can be played alone or with a group of friends using the machine's wireless capabilities. it certainly looks impressive on the small machine and plays smoothly even with a group of people.

the game can be controlled by using the supplied stylus to aim. the top screen is used to navigate the action while the bottom screen offers a top-down map and the ability to switch weapons. it is certainly a unique control method and while it makes aiming more controlled it can be a little disorientating. super mario 64 ds is a faithful re-creation of the nintendo 64 classic with a host of new mini-games and new levels. the game looks stunning on the portable machine and the sound too is impressive for such a small machine. one thing is for certain. hardened gamers will have to learn to adapt to a new way of playing while it could prove to be an accessible way in to gaming for novices, ultimately the success or failure of the device lies in the hands of developers. if they manage to create titles which use the nintendo ds's key features then a whole new market of gamers could open up. the fear is that the touch screen and voice recognition are treated as little more than gimmicks.

european champions wasps are set to offer matt dawson a new deal.

""rugby is still my priority and there's still a burning desire within me to play the best rugby i possibly can,"" he said. ""i know within myself, if i was given the chance i could play for england again. ""i know i'm fit enough, i'm strong enough, i'm skilful enough.""

480,"man utd through after exeter test

manchester united avoided an fa cup upset by edging past exeter city in their third round replay.

cristiano ronaldo scored the opener, slipping the ball between paul jones' legs after just nine minutes. united wasted a host of chances to make it safe as jones made some great saves, but wayne rooney put the tie beyond doubt late on with a cool finish. exeter had chances of their own, sean devine twice volleying wide and andrew taylor forcing tim howard to save. united boss sir alex ferguson was taking few chances after their 0-0 draw in the first game and he handed starts to paul scholes and ryan as well as ronaldo and rooney. exeter began brightly with devine and steve flack seeing plenty of the ball, but it did not take united long to assert their authority and the hosts soon found themselves a goal down. scholes played a lovely pass in to ronaldo on the left-hand side of the six-yard box and the portuguese winger slid the ball between the legs of jones to open the scoring.

united sensed a chance to finish the tie as a contest early on and ronaldo blazed over before jones saved well from scholes and then rooney. the visitors' pressure by now was incessant and rooney had another shot blocked while ronaldo slammed well over the bar again from a good position. just before the break giggs had a golden chance to double the advantage, but the welshman dragged a left-foot effort badly wide from 10 yards. in stoppage time exeter created their best chance as alex jeannin swung in a cross from the left that devine managed to flick goalwards, but the ball flew wide of howard's goal. the grecians came out after the break in determined fashion and howard had to show safe hands to collect two searching crosses into the united box. rooney looked like he might have sealed the result with a turn and shot but the ball stuck in the st james park mud and jones raced back to gather on the goalline. moments later devine had the chance to make himself a hero, but he could only volley jeannin's brilliant cross wide of howard's goal after being left unmarked six yards out. after rooney had completely messed up a free-kick 20 yards out taylor showed him how it should be done, his stunning drive from distance forcing a flying stop from howard. the home crowd were baying for a goal and they did get the ball into the net only for devine's low effort to be ruled out for an obvious offside. the persistent rooney eventually rounded jones with three minutes to go and slotted into an empty net to book a home tie with middlesbrough in the fourth round.

shares in manchester united closed up 4.75% on monday following a new offer from us tycoon malcolm glazer.

the board of the football club is expected to meet early this week to discuss the latest proposal, which values the club at â£800m ($1.5bn). manchester united revealed on sunday that it had received a detailed proposal from mr glazer, which looks set to receive more serious scrutiny. the club has previously rejected mr glazer's approaches out of hand. but a senior source at the club told the bbc: ""this time it's different."" supporters' group shareholders united, however, urged the club to reject the new deal.

a spokesman for the shareholders united said: ""i can't see any difference (compared to mr glazer's previous proposals) other than â£200m less debt. ""he isn't bringing any money into the club; he'll use our money to buy it.""

mr glazer's latest move is being led by mr glazer's two sons, avi and joel, according to the financial times. a proposal was received by david gill, united's chief executive, at the end of last week, pitched at about 300p a share. david cummings, head of uk equities for standard life investments, said he believed a ""well funded"" 300p a share bid would be enough for mr glazer to take control of the club.

""i do not think there is anything that manchester united fans can do about it,"" he told the bbc. ""they can complain about it but it is curtains for them. they may not want him but they are going to get him."" the us tycoon, who has been wooing the club for the last 12 months, has approached the united board with ""detailed proposals"", it has confirmed.

mr glazer, who owns the tampa bay buccaneers team, hopes this will lead to a formal bid being accepted. he is believed to have increased the amount of equity in the new proposal, though it is not clear by how much. for his proposal to succeed, he needs the support of united's largest shareholders, the irish horseracing tycoons jp mcmanus and john magnier. they own 29% of united through their cubic expression investment vehicle. mr glazer and his family hold a stake of 28.1%. but it is not yet known whether mr mcmanus and mr magnier would support a glazer bid. nm rothschild, the investment bank, is advising mr glazer, according to the financial times. his previous adviser, jpmorgan, quit last year when mr glazer went ahead and voted against the appointment of three united directors to the board, against its advice. but the ft said it thought jp morgan may still have had some role in financing mr glazer's latest financial proposal.

1155,"consumer concern over rfid tags

consumers are very concerned about the use of radio frequency id (rfid) tags in shops, a survey says.

more than half of 2,000 people surveyed said they had privacy worries about the tags, which can be used to monitor stock on shelves or in warehouses. some consumer groups have expressed concern that the tags could be used to monitor shoppers once they had left shops with their purchases. the survey showed that awareness of tags among consumers in europe was low. the survey of consumers in the uk, france, germany and the netherlands was carried out by consultancy group capgemini. the firm works on behalf of more than 30 firms who are seeking to promote the growth of rfid technology. the tags are a combination of computer chip and antenna which can be read by a scanner - each item contains a unique identification number.

more than half (55%) of the respondents said they were either concerned or very concerned that rfid tags would allow businesses to track consumers via product purchases. fifty nine percent of people said they were worried that rfid tags would allow data to be used more freely by third parties. ard jan vetham, capgemini's principal consultant on rfid, said the survey showed that retailers needed to inform and educate people about rfid before it would become accepted technology. ""acceptance of new technologies always has a tipping point at which consumers believe that benefits outweigh concerns. ""with the right rfid approach and ongoing communication with consumers, the industry can reach this point."" he said that the survey also showed people would accept rfid if they felt that the technology could mean a reduction in car theft or faster recovery of stolen items. the tags are currently being used at one tesco distribution centre in the uk - the tags allow the rapid inventory of bulk items. they are also in use as a passcard for the m6 toll in the midlands, in the uk. mr vetham said the majority of people surveyed (52%) believed that rfid tags could be read from a distance. he said that was a misconception based on a lack of awareness of the technology. at least once consumer group - consumers against supermarket privacy invasion and numbering (caspian) - has claimed that rfid chips could be used to secretly identify people and the things they are carrying or wearing. all kinds of personal belongings, including clothes, could constantly broadcast messages about their whereabouts and their owners, it warned.

uk gamers have until 12 november to register their interest in taking part and can sign up via the four-kings, jolt.co.uk and painkiller tournament websites. philip wride, who co-manages the four-kings team, said online qualifiers will be held from 16-28 november to find the best eight players of the painkiller game. he said the clan was running the contest because four-kings does not currently have any players that excel at painkiller. these eight players will be brought together in london on 3-5 december for the bloodline tournament that will find the best two players.

the event will be filmed and the final cut made available online for others to watch. the movie is being put together by simon bysshe who has shot many other films about pro-gaming that have been widely shared online. said mr bysshe: ""painkiller is a new game and the opportunity is there for a new player to step up."" painkiller has been described as a game that adds a few modern touches, such as improved graphics, to the old-fashioned first-person shooter. these two players will be put forward as the uk's entrants to the cyberathlete professional league $1m painkiller contest that will take place throughout 2005. the event is being billed as the cpl world tour and will be arranged around ten separate tournaments at different locations around the world. travel expenses to all the stops on the tour will be paid by four-kings for the two uk players who make the grade. the top prize at each stop on the world tour will be $15,000. a further $150,000 will be given to the winner of the grand final due to be held in december 2005. mr wride said any gamer that wins a few tour stop tournaments and the grand final will have a very good year. the first stop on the world tour will be istanbul, turkey from 10-13 february. a total of $50,000 in cash prizes is on offer. the cpl has said that it picked a one-on-one game such as painkiller to make it easier for spectators to follow the action. counter-strike, by far the most popular online game, pits teams against each other and can be confusing to follow if those watching are not familiar with the layout of the maps on which it is played. the decision to pick painkiller was greeted with surprise by many gamers, as it was widely expected that doom 3 would be chosen as the one-one-one title.

2204,"'strong dollar' call halts slide

the us dollar's slide against the euro and yen has halted after us treasury secretary john snow said a strong dollar was ""in america's interest"".

but analysts said any gains are likely to be short-lived as problems with the us economy were still significant. they also pointed out that positive comments apart, president george w bush's administration had done little to stop the dollar's slide. a weak dollar helps boost exports and narrow the current account deficit. the dollar was trading at $1.2944 against the euro at 2100gmt, still close to the $1.3006 record level set on 10 november. against the japanese yen, it was trading at 105.28 yen, after hitting a seven-month low of 105.17 earlier in the day.

policy makers in europe have called the dollar's slide ""brutal"" and have blamed the strength of the euro for dampening economic growth. however, it is unclear whether ministers would issue a declaration aimed at curbing the euro's rise at a monthly meeting of eurozone ministers late on monday. higher growth in europe is regarded by us officials as a way the huge us current account deficit - that has been weighing on the dollar - could be reduced. mr snow who is currently in dublin at the start of a four-nation eu visit, has applauded ireland's introduction of lower taxes and deregulation which have helped boost growth. ""the eurozone is growing below its potential. when a major part of the global economy is below potential there are negative consequences... for the citizens of those economies... and for their trading partners,"" he said. mr snow's comments may have helped shore up the dollar on monday, but he was careful to qualify his statement.

""our basic policy, of course, is to let open, competitive markets set the values,"" he explained. ""markets are driven by fundamentals and towards fundamentals."" us officials have also said that other economies need to grow, so the us is not the main global growth engine. economists say that the fundamentals, or key indicators, of the us economy are looking far from rosy. domestic consumer demand is cooling, and heavy spending by president bush has pushed the budget deficit to a record $427bn (â£230bn). the current account deficit, meanwhile, hit a record $166bn in the second quarter of 2004. for many analysts, a weaker dollar is here to stay. ""no end is in sight,"" said carsten fritsch, a strategist at commerzbank . ""it is only a matter of time until the euro reaches $1.30."" some analysts maintain the us is secretly happy with a lower dollar which helps makes its exports cheaper in europe, thus boosting its economy.

2217,"japanese growth grinds to a halt

growth in japan evaporated in the three months to september, sparking renewed concern about an economy not long out of a decade-long trough.

output in the period grew just 0.1%, an annual rate of 0.3%. exports - the usual engine of recovery - faltered, while domestic demand stayed subdued and corporate investment also fell short. the growth falls well short of expectations, but does mark a sixth straight quarter of expansion.

the economy had stagnated throughout the 1990s, experiencing only brief spurts of expansion amid long periods in the doldrums. one result was deflation - prices falling rather than rising - which made japanese shoppers cautious and kept them from spending.

the effect was to leave the economy more dependent than ever on exports for its recent recovery. but high oil prices have knocked 0.2% off the growth rate, while the falling dollar means products shipped to the us are becoming relatively more expensive.

the performance for the third quarter marks a sharp downturn from earlier in the year. the first quarter showed annual growth of 6.3%, with the second showing 1.1%, and economists had been predicting as much as 2% this time around. ""exports slowed while capital spending became weaker,"" said hiromichi shirakawa, chief economist at ubs securities in tokyo. ""personal consumption looks good, but it was mainly due to temporary factors such as the olympics. ""the amber light is flashing."" the government may now find it more difficult to raise taxes, a policy it will have to implement when the economy picks up to help deal with japan's massive public debt.

ireland captain brian o'driscoll has been ruled out of saturday's rbs six nations clash against scotland.

o'driscoll was originally named in the starting line-up but has failed to recover from the hamstring injury he picked up in the win over italy. his replacement will be named after training on friday morning. fellow centre gordon d'arcy is also struggling with a hamstring injury and he will undergo a fitness test on friday to see if he can play.

kevin maggs would be an obvious replacement at centre while shane horgan could also be moved from wing. ulster wing tommy bowe could also be asked to travel with the squad to scotland as a precautionary measure. the only other change to the ireland side sees wasps flanker johnny o'connor replacing denis leamy. o'connor will be winning his third cap after making his debut in the victory over south africa last november.

1185,"looks and music to drive mobiles

mobile phones are still enjoying a boom time in sales, according to research from technology analysts gartner.

more than 674 million mobiles were sold last year globally, said the report, the highest total sold to date. the figure was 30% more than in 2003 and surpassed even the most optimistic predictions, gartner said. good design and the look of a mobile, as well as new services such as music downloads, could go some way to pushing up sales in 2005, said analysts. although people were still looking for better replacement phones, there was evidence, according to gartner, that some markets were seeing a slow-down in replacement sales.

""all the markets grew apart from japan which shows that replacement sales are continuing in western europe,"" mobile analyst carolina milanesi told the bbc news website. ""japan is where north america and western european markets can be in a couple of years' time. ""they already have tv, music, ringtones, cameras, and all that we can think of on mobiles, so people have stopped buying replacement phones.""

but there could be a slight slowdown in sales in european and us markets too, according to gartner, as people wait to see what comes next in mobile technology. this means mobile companies have to think carefully about what they are offering in new models so that people see a compelling reason to upgrade, said gartner. third generation mobiles (3g) with the ability to handle large amounts of data transfer, like video, could drive people into upgrading their phones, but ms milanesi said it was difficult to say how quickly that would happen. ""at the end of the day, people have cameras and colour screens on mobiles and for the majority of people out there who don't really care about technology the speed of data to a phone is not critical."" nor would the rush to produce two or three megapixel camera phones be a reason for mobile owners to upgrade on its own. the majority of camera phone models are not at the stage where they can compete with digital cameras which also have flashes and zooms.

more likely to drive sales in 2005 would be the attention to design and aesthetics, as well as music services. the motorola razr v3 phone was typical of the attention to design that would be more commonplace in 2005, she added. this was not a ""women's thing"", she said, but a desire from men and women to have a gadget that is a form of self-expression too. it was not just about how the phone functioned, but about what it said about its owner. ""western europe has always been a market which is quite attentive to design,"" said ms milanesi.

""people are after something that is nice-looking, and together with that, there is the entertainment side. ""this year music will have a part to play in this."" the market for full-track music downloads was worth just $20 million (â£10.5 million) in 2004, but is set to be worth $1.8 billion (â£9.4 million) by 2009, according to jupiter research. sony ericsson just released its walkman branded mobile phone, the w800, which combines a digital music player with up to 30 hours' battery life, and a two megapixel camera. in july last year, motorola and apple announced a version of itunes online music downloading service would be released which would be compatible with motorola mobile phones. apple said the new itunes music player would become motorola's standard music application for its music phones. but the challenge will be balancing storage capacity with battery life if mobile music hopes to compete with digital music players like the ipod. ms milanesi said more models would likely be released in the coming year with hard drives. but they would be more likely to compete with the smaller capacity music players that have around four gigabyte storage capacity, which would not put too much strain on battery life.

1171,"speak easy plan for media players

music and film fans will be able to control their digital media players just by speaking to them, under plans in development by two us firms.

scansoft and gracenote are developing technology to give people access to their film and music libraries simply by voice control. they want to give people hands-free access to digital music and films in the car, or at home or on the move. huge media libraries on some players can make finding single songs hard. ""voice command-and-control unlocks the potential of devices that can store large digital music collections,"" said ross blanchard, vice president of business development for gracenote. ""these applications will radically change the car entertainment experience, allowing drivers to enjoy their entire music collections without ever taking their hands off the steering wheel,"" he added.

gracenote provides music library information for millions of different albums for jukeboxes such as apple's itunes. the new technology will be designed so that people can play any individual song or movie out of a collection, just by saying its name. users will also be able to request music that fits a mood or an occasion, or a film just by saying the actor's name. ""speech is a natural fit for today's consumer devices, particularly in mobile environments,"" said alan schwartz, vice president of speechworks, a division of scansoft.

2051,"bush budget seeks deep cutbacks

president bush has presented his 2006 budget, cutting domestic spending in a bid to lower a record deficit projected to peak at $427bn (â£230bn) this year.

the $2.58 trillion (â£1.38 trillion) budget submitted to congress affects 150 domestic programmes from farming to the environment, education and health. but foreign aid is due to rise by 10%, with more money to treat hiv/aids and reward economic and political reform. military spending is also set to rise by 4.8%, to reach $419.3bn. the budget does not include the cost of running military operations in iraq and afghanistan, for which the administration is expected to seek an extra $80bn from congress later this year.

congress will spend several months debating george w bush's proposal.

the state department's planned budget would rise to just under $23bn - a fraction of the defence department's request - including almost $6bn to assist us allies in the ""war on terror"". however, the administration is keen to highlight its global effort to tackle hiv/aids, the bbc's jonathan beale reports, and planned spending would almost double to $3bn, with much of that money going to african nations. mr bush also wants to increase the amount given to poorer countries through his millennium challenge corporation. the scheme has been set up to reward developing countries that embrace what the us considers to be good governance and sound policies. yet mr bush's proposed spending of $3bn on that project is well below his initial promise of $5bn.

a key spending line missing from proposals is the cost of funding the administration's proposed radical overhaul of social security, the pensions programme on which many americans rely for their retirement income.

some experts believe this could require borrowing of up to $4.5 trillion over a 20-year period. neither does the budget include any cash to purchase crude oil for the us emergency petroleum stockpile. concern over the level of the reserve, created in 1970s, has led to rises in oil prices over the past year. the bush administration will instead continue to fill the reserve by taking oil - rather than cash - from energy companies that drill under federal leases.

the outline proposes reductions in budgets at 12 out of 23 government agencies including cuts of 9.6% at agriculture and 5.6% at the environmental protection agency. the spending plan for the year beginning 1 october is banking on a healthy us economy to boost government income by 6.1% to $2.18 trillion. spending is forecast to grow by 3.5% to $2.57 trillion. but the budget is still the tightest yet under mr bush's presidency. ""in order to sustain our economic expansion, we must continue pro-growth policies and enforce even greater spending restraint across federal government,"" mr bush said in his budget message to congress. mr bush has promised to halve the us's massive budget deficit within five years. the deficit, partly the result of massive tax cuts early in mr bush's presidency, has been a key factor in pushing the us dollar lower. the independent congressional budget office estimates that the shortfall could shrink to little more than $200bn by 2009, returning to the surpluses seen in the late 1990s by 2012. but its estimates depend on the tax cuts not being made permanent, in line with the promise when they were passed that they would ""sunset"", or disappear, in 2010. most republicans, however, want them to stay in place. and the figures also rely on the ""social security trust fund"" - the money set aside to cover the swelling costs of retirement pensions - being offset against the main budget deficit.

ireland fly-half ronan o'gara hailed his side's 19-13 victory over england as a ""special"" win.

the munster number 10 kicked a total of 14 points, including two drop goals, to help keep alive their grand slam hopes. he told bbc sport: ""we made hard work of it but it's still special to beat england. ""i had three chances to win the game but didn't. we have work to do after this but we never take a victory over england lightly."" ireland hooker shane byrne echoed o'gara's comments but admitted the game had been england's best outing in the six nations. byrne said: ""it was a really, really hard game but from one to 15 in our team we worked really, really hard. ""we just had to stick to our defensive pattern, trust ourselves and trust those around us. all round it was fantastic."" ireland captain brian o'driscoll, who scored his side's only try, said: ""we are delighted, we felt if we performed well then we would win but with england also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter. ""we did get the bounce of the ball and some days that happens and you've just got to jump on the back of it.""

ireland coach eddie o'sullivan was surprised that england coach andy robinson said he was certain mark cueto was onside for a disallowed try just before the break. ""andy was sitting two yards from me and i couldn't see whether he was offside or not so i don't know how andy could have known,"" said o'sullivan.

""what i do know is that england played well and when that happens it makes a very good victory for us. ""we had to defend for long periods and that is all good for the confidence of the team. ""i think our try was very well worked, it was a gem, as good a try as we have scored for a while."" o'sullivan also rejected robinson's contention england dominated the forward play. ""i think we lost one lineout and they lost four or five so i don't know how that adds up to domination,"" he said. o'driscoll also insisted ireland were happy to handle the pressure of being considered favourites to win the six nations title.

1082,"mobile multimedia slow to catch on

there is no doubt that mobile phones sporting cameras and colour screens are hugely popular. consumers swapping old phones for slinkier, dinkier versions are thought to be responsible for a 26% increase in the number of phones sold during the third quarter of 2004, according to analysts gartner more than 167 million handsets were sold between july and september 2004, a period that, according to gartner analyst carolina milanesi is ""seldom strong"". but although consumers have mobiles that can take and send snaps, sounds and video clips few, so far, are taking the chance to do so.

in fact, the numbers of people not taking and sending pictures, audio and video is growing. figures gathered by continental research shows that 36% of british camera phone users have never sent a multimedia message (mms), up from 7% in 2003. this is despite the fact that, during the same period, the numbers of camera phones in the uk more than doubled to 7.5 million. getting mobile phone users to send multimedia messages is really important for operators keen to squeeze more cash out of their customers and offset the cost of subsidising the handsets people are buying. the problem they face, said shailendra jain, head of mms firm adamind, is educating people in how to send the multimedia messages using their funky handsets.

""also,"" he said, ""they have to simplify the interface so its not rocket science in terms of someone understanding it."" research bears out the suspicion that people are not sending multimedia messages because they do not know how to. according to continental research, 29% of the people it questioned said they were technophobes that tended to shy away from innovation. only 11% regarded themselves as technically savvy enough to send a picture or video message. the fact that multimedia services are not interoperable across networks and phones only adds to people's reluctance to start sending them, said mr jain. ""they ask themselves: 'if i'm streaming video from one handset to another will it work?'"" he said. ""there's a lot of user apprehension about that.""

there are other deeper technical reasons why multimedia messages are not being pushed as strongly as they might. andrew bud, executive chairman of messaging firm mblox, said mobile phone operators cap the number of messages that can be circulating at any one time for fear of overwhelming the system. ""the rate we can send mms into the mobile network is fairly constant,"" he said. the reason for this is that there are finite capacities for data traffic on the second generation networks that currently have the most users.

no-one wants to take the risk of swamping these relatively narrow channels so the number of mms messages is capped, said mr bud. this has led to operators finding other technologies, particularly one known as wap-push, to get multimedia to their customers. but when networks do find a good way to get multimedia to their customers, the results can be dramatic. israeli technology firm celltick has found a way to broadcast data across phone networks in a way that does not overwhelm existing bandwidth. one of the first firms to use the celltick service is hutch india, the largest mobile firm in the country. the broadcast system gets multimedia to customers via a rolling menu far faster than would be possible with other systems. while not multimedia messaging, such a system gets people used to seeing their phones as a device that can handle all different types of content. as a result 40% of the subscribers to the hutch alive, which uses celltick's broadcast technology, regularly click for more pictures, sounds and images from the operator. ""operators really need to start utilising this tool to reach their customers,"" said yaron toren, spokesman for celltick. until then, multimedia will be a message that is not getting through.

1127,"sporting rivals go to extra time

the current slew of sports games offers unparalleled opportunities for fans who like to emulate on-field action without ever moving from the couch.

the two giants in the field - espn and ea sports - have been locked in a heavyweight battle for years. the latter is the world's largest games manufacturer. years of experience mean that the titles in their steady flow of sport sims are finely honed, massively entertaining and ooze flair. sports broadcaster espn, meanwhile, has leant its name to a series of games that are similarly classy but lower in profile and price. but that status quo was changed forever - or for the next 15 years at least - by a deal earlier this year when espn sold ea the rights to its tv branding and on-air talent, meaning the espn games presently developed by sega will have to come to and end in their present form.

it was a massive-money deal that not only raised eyebrows but stirred active indignation in many quarters, with fans concerned that it is set to enable ea to monopolise the sports gaming landscape to an unhealthy degree. some particularly disgruntled fans set up an online petition that notched more than 18,000 virtual signatures. many of those clicking to complain were already rankled, for the espn coup happened just weeks after ea had pulled off another enormous licensing deal, controversially giving them exclusive rights to teams and personnel from america&#191;s national football league (nfl). so, will the sega - espn range be missed? a key reason for answering ""yes"" is that liking or disliking a sports game regularly comes down to personal taste, and having some options available always proves hugely handy. online soccer fans will testify to that, between bouts of arguing over which high-profile title rules supreme out of the similar-yet-hugely-different fifa 2005 and pro evolution soccer 4. on the same note, the espn 2k5 and ea sports games have so little to choose between them that picking favourites will come down to players' personal preferences and spending budget rather than any technical elements. taking hockey and basketball as examples, both publishers' efforts are phenomenally entertaining and fairly accessible. they also both look awesome, with the sega / espn versions perhaps shading things on a graphical front.

in terms of gameplay, i marginally preferred ea's nba live 2005 for basketball, and was more satisfied ice hockey-wise by espn's nhl 2k5. the espn games are a touch more arcade-like in look and feel and are slightly easier to get into, although like their rivals, they also offer a dizzyingly-extensive array of in-game tricks and overall challenge modes that should be enough to quench thirsts of even the most die-hard of sports fans. perhaps the most interesting aspect of the espn deal will be seeing how it affects the presentation of ea's future titles. the front-end decoration of ea's games has become something of an art-form in itself, loaded with slick visuals and oodles of licensed music. they are also immediately identifiable as coming from the ea stable, and the inevitable compulsion to add an espn look will no doubt change that in various ways. what is a shame is that the espn titles took similar care about framing the gameplay with an authentic setting - their preambles look and sound much like they would on tv. they are neat and excellent-value games in their current form, and combining them with ea's own established brand should produce a truly formidable beast.

1200,"nintendo handheld given euro date

nintendo's new handheld console, the ds, will launch in europe on 11 march, the company has announced.

the portable games machine, which features touch-screen control, will retail for â£99 in the uk (149 euros). nintendo said 15 games would be available in the uk at launch, with prices ranging from â£19 to â£29. more than 2.8 million ds consoles have been sold since it first appeared in the us and japan at the end of 2004. rival sony has said it will launch its first handheld console, the psp, in the us and europe before the end of march. the psp is expected to compete for a large part of the same handheld market, despite sony's assertion that the machines are aimed at different consumers.

the 15 games available on the european launch date will include nintendo's super mario 64 ds, as well as titles from third-party developers such as ubisoft's rayman ds.

more than 120 games are in development for the new console, nintendo has said. the ds is backwards compatible with the game boy advance, allowing the earlier machine's back catalogue of 700 games to be played. additionally, a short-range wireless link for multiplayer gaming is built in to the ds, with a ""download play"" option which allows a group to play against each other, even if just one person owns a copy. other features include a short-range messaging application called pictochat, and a built-in microphone which is used in sega's launch title project rub. nintendo has also announced a media adapter, which will allow the console to play music and video on the move.

the launch price of â£99 (149 euros) compares favourably with the us price of $149, according to john houlihan, editor of the computerandvideogames.com magazine. ""it's a very, very competitive price point. there are some innovative features, and nintendo has created quite a buzz,"" he says. ""however, the line-up of games could have been stronger. everyone wanted to see the eight-player mario kart ds, for example.""

mr houlihan believes that there is likely to be an audience for both the nintendo ds and sony's new psp, with the former aimed largely at a younger audience and the latter expected to be marketed as a multimedia device. ""the psp is a sexy bit of kit, but sony's attitude to the psp has been very understated in europe, so far,"" mr houlihan said. the worldwide handheld software market had an estimated worth of $2.6bn at the end of 2004, according to industry analysts screen digest.

648,"ireland surge past scots

ireland maintained their six nations grand slam ambitions with an impressive victory over scotland at murrayfield.

hugo southwell's try gave the scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks malcolm o'kelly and paul o'connell put the visitors in command by half-time. a third try from wing denis hickie and third penalty from ronan o'gara, who kicked 13 points, extended the lead. jon petrie scored a second try for scotland but late scores from john hayes and gavin duffy sealed victory. after two hard-earned away victories, eddie o'sullivan' side can now look forward to welcoming england to lansdowne road in a fortnight. scotland will try to give their coach matt williams a first six nations victory when italy come to edinburgh, but they again struggled to turn pressure into points. the home side started with tremendous intensity and dominated territory and possession in the opening 10 minutes. a powerful charge from flanker jason white was carried on by ali hogg and when ireland conceded a penalty close to their own line, scotland kicked it to touch. the irish defence foiled the home side on that occasion, but a stray hand in a ruck allowed paterson to stroke over a penalty in the eighth minute.

if that was a paltry reward for their early pressure, scotland got the try they deserved when paterson's searing break and andy craig's pass sent southwell streaking to the right corner. paterson was off target with the conversion and fly-half dan parks then missed a presentable drop-goal attempt. ireland got themselves on the scoreboard with an o'gara penalty and by the 24th minute the visitors were ahead. stuart grimes pulled down o'kelly at a line-out, ireland kicked the penalty to touch and from the set-piece, the big lock was driven over by the rest of his pack.

o'gara added the conversion and a further penalty, after shane horgan almost grabbed a second try from o'gara's chip to the corner, only for the ball to spill from his hand. but ireland still delivered a hammer blow to scotland's hopes just before the interval. o'connell - skipper in the absence of brian o'driscoll - powered through parks' weak tackle after a free-kick from a scrummage to burrow over.

scotland suffered a further blow on the resumption when ireland flanker johnny o'connor won another vital turnover, and o'gara's basketball pass sent hickie over in the left corner. o'gara converted and then thumped over a 40m penalty to give the visitors a commanding 28-8 advantage. scotland looked bereft of ideas but a half-break from paterson sparked them back to life just before the hour. stuart grimes won a line-out and a well-worked move saw petrie scuttle round the side of the ruck to dive over in the left corner. but it proved a false dawn, and ireland reasserted their authority in the final 10 minutes. peter stringer and o'kelly combined to put giant prop hayes over in the right corner before replacement gavin duffy scorched away on the left, david humphreys adding the final flourish with a touchline conversion.

500,"european medal chances improve

what have the european indoor trials told us? well, i think we could be heading to the european championships with half a dozen medal prospects.

it was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward, to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around.

the best performance on the track for me was sarah claxton's win in the 60m hurdles. running sub-eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in madrid she will be close to picking up a medal. but what was great about sunday's performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted. diane allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and i think she was surprised to be beaten by sarah. and knowing that she got the better of diane in a head-to-head race will give sarah confidence. in the men's race on saturday, allan scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him. in fact, the men's 60m hurdles is so strong, i think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to madrid.

phillips idowu lit up the field events, not only with his hair, but also with his leap of 17.30m, which puts him at the top of the world rankings. i had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there. he feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him - but then phillips always has. a lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful, so for phillips to jump like that is a good performance. he is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency - and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further. across the board i thought kelly sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing. she picked up three personal bests in the long jump, high jump and 60m hurdles and you can't ask for more than that. kelly will be up against carolina kluft in the pentathlon at the european championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we've seen so far.

she has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well. it wasn't all good news in sheffield. i thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways. jason gardener may have won but he wasn't at his best. i chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off-day for him. he's there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there. in the women's race, jeanette kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion joice maduaka. the pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but joice had to pull out with a chest infection. if she had made the final i think jeanette would have gone a bit quicker.

janine whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a two-year drugs ban. but the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldn't be the case. the event has moved on immensely since janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition i think that would help her. a couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding mark findlay and rabah yusuf. findlay is a londoner who has chosen to represent trinidad and tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for great britain. yusuf, who came third in the 400m, is from the sudan but is trying to gain british citizenship. he came to britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe, started doing more running and found his talent. so we shall have to see what happens to both of them.

1193,"gamer buys $26,500 virtual land

a 22-year-old gamer has spent $26,500 (â£13,700) on an island that exists only in a computer role-playing game (rpg).

the australian gamer, known only by his gaming moniker deathifier, bought the island in an online auction. the land exists within the game project entropia, an rpg which allows thousands of players to interact with each other. entropia allows gamers to buy and sell virtual items using real cash, while fans of other titles often use auction site ebay to sell their virtual wares. earlier this year economists calculated that these massively multi-player online role-playing games (mmorpgs) have a gross economic impact equivalent to the gdp of the african nation of namibia.

""this is a historic moment in gaming history, and this sale only goes to prove that massive multi-player online gaming has reached a new plateau,"" said marco behrmann, director of community relations at mindark, the game's developer.

the virtual island includes a gigantic abandoned castle and beautiful beaches which are described as ripe for developing beachfront property. deathifier will make money from his investment as he is able to tax other gamers who come to his virtual land to hunt or mine for gold. he has also begun to sell plots to people who wish to build virtual homes. ""this type of investment will definitely become a trend in online gaming,"" said deathifier. the entopia economy lets gamers exchange real currency into ped (project entropia dollars) and back again into real money. ten peds are the equivalent to one us dollar and typical items sold include iron ingots ($5) and shogun armour ($1.70) gamers can theoretically earn money by accumulating peds through the acquisition of goods, buildings, and land in the entropia universe. mmorpgs have become enormously popular in the last 10 years with hundreds of thousands of gamers living out alternate lives in fantasy worlds. almost 200,000 people are registered players on project entropia.

703,"federer joins all-time greats

the last year has seen one player dominate men's tennis, and one country dominate the women's game.

roger federer became the first man since mats wilander in 1988 to win three grand slams in one season. and after anastasia myskina became the first russian woman to win a grand slam at the french open, two more followed at wimbledon and the us open. meanwhile, briton tim henman enjoyed his best year, while greg rusedski fought back superbly from adversity. federer began the year as world number one and holder of the wimbledon and masters cup titles, and set about conquering new ground. the swiss sounded warning of the dominance to come at the australian open.

he ripped through the draw before beating marat safin in the final. andy roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at wimbledon, and federer's performance against lleyton hewitt in the us open final was breathtaking. federer again got the better of hewitt in the season-ending masters cup. his victory in houston proved to be his 13th successive win in a final, an open era record. the only major let-down was a third-round loss to gustavo kuerten at the french open, and roland garros will be his main target in 2005.

there was also a surprise loss to the unheralded tomas berdych at the olympic games, which saw chile dominate as nicoals massu took the singles and then paired up with fernando gonzaelz to win doubles gold. another major trophy that looks beyond federer is the davis cup, which was won by spain in a 3-2 home success over the usa in seville. roddick struggled on the clay, losing to rafael nadal on the opening day before going down to carlos moya in the all-important fourth rubber.

henman broke new ground by reaching the semis on clay at the french open - a stunning effort - and also at the us open. a quarter-final defeat to mario ancic at wimbledon was disappointing for the limp manner of the briton's defeat, but he remains optimistic of going further next year.

british number two rusedski endured a rollercoaster year, returning to the circuit after being cleared of a doping offence in march. with his ranking down at 168, many feared the 31-year-old's career was over, but he battled back in the second half of the season to re-enter the top 50. the russian women finally delivered on their long-recognised promise in 2004, with myskina, maria sharapova and svetlana kuznetsova winning grand slams, before taking the season-ending fed cup. but while the young russians were on the way up, it was a different story for the belgians and the williams sisters. only veteran lindsay davenport held the new wave at bay, a stunning run of form after wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of amelie mauresmo, whose grand slam drought goes on. the year started in regulation fashion as justine henin-hardenne beat compatriot kim clijsters at the australian open.

a virus ruined the rest of henin-hardenne's year, although she was fit enough to win olympic gold, but clijsters had an even more miserable 2004. she suffered a serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with lleyton hewitt, and will be happy to see the year end. in their absence, myskina thrashed elena dementieva in a historic, but woeful, all-russian final at the french open. wimbledon was a more refreshing affair as sharapova captivated sw19, showing nerves of steel as she battled past davenport and serena williams to take the title.

davenport was a strong favourite for the us open but, hampered by injury, lost to the powerful and unflappable kuznetsova in the semis. kuznetsova went on to give dementieva another grand slam final thrashing, with the latter's wayward serve becoming one of the talking points of the year. with the russians still improving, the likes of henin-hardenne, clijsters, davenport, mauresmo, venus and serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in 2005. and it may take their compatriot safin to challenge federer on the men's side.

1810,"japanese mogul arrested for fraud

one of japan's best-known businessmen was arrested on thursday on charges of falsifying shareholder information and selling shares based on the false data.

yoshiaki tsutsumi was once ranked as the world's richest man and ran a business spanning hotels, railways, construction and a baseball team. his is the latest in a series of arrests of top executives in japan over business scandals. he was taken away in a van outside one of his prince hotels in tokyo.

there was a time when mr tsutsumi seemed untouchable. inheriting a large property business from his father in the 1960s, he became one of japan's most powerful industrialists, with close connections to many of the country's leading politicians. he used his wealth and influence to bring the winter olympic games to nagano in 1998. but last year, he was forced to resign from all the posts he held in his business empire, after being accused of falsifying the share-ownership structure of seibu railways, one of his companies. under japanese stock market rules, no listed company can be more than 80% owned by its 10 largest shareholders. now mr tsutsumi faces criminal charges and the possibility of a prison sentence because he made it look as if the 10 biggest shareholders owned less than this amount. seibu railways has been delisted from the stock exchange, its share value has plunged and it is the target of a takeover bid.

mr tsutsumi's fall from grace follows the arrests of several other top executives in japan as the authorities try to curb the murky business practices which were once widespread in japanese companies. his determination to stay at the top at all costs may have had its roots in his childhood. the illegitimate third son of a rich father, who made his money buying up property as japan rebuilt after world war ii, he has described the demands his father made. ""i felt enormous pressure when i dined with him and it was nothing but pain,"" tsutsumi told a weekly magazine in 1987. ""he scolded me for pouring too much soy sauce or told me fruit was not for children. he didn't let me use the silk futon, saying it's a luxury."" there have been corporate governance issues at some other japanese companies too. last year, twelve managers from mitsubishi motors were charged with covering up safety defects in their vehicles and three executives from japan's troubled ufj bank were charged with concealing the extent of the bank's bad loans.

""everyone has strong opinions about this and we wanted to open it up to the public to decide,"" he added. bbc radio scotland presenter vic galloway, who has been involved in the project, said it had been ""great fun"" to look back at scotland's musical heritage and take note of up-and-coming scottish acts.

2216,"ec calls truce in deficit battle

the european commission (ec) has called a truce in its battle with france and germany over breaching deficit limits.

the move came after france and germany vowed to run their budget deficits below the eu cap in 2005 - for the first time in four years. but, the ec did warn the two were under close scrutiny and it would act if their fiscal situations deteriorated. under eu rules, member countries must keep their deficits below 3%. france and germany will breach that this year. it will be the third year in a row that the two countries have broken the european union's stability and growth pact rules.

the eurozone's two biggest economies left the pact in tatters in november 2003 when they persuaded fellow eu members to put the threat of penalties for deficit breaches on hold.

the commission then took the pair to the european court of human justice - which ruled eu countries could not put the pact ""in abeyance"", and confirmed the ec's right to launch ""excessive debt procedures"". after announcing its decision to erase france and germany from its list of deficit rule breakers, the eu said that the time lag created by the ruling meant that 2005 should be the target year for the pair to bring their budget's below 3%. ""the commission concludes that the two countries appear to be on track to correct their excessive deficits by 2005,"" it said in a statement. the eu expects the german deficit to fall to fall to 2.9% of gdp next year from 3.9% this year, while france's is forecast to drop to 3% from an expected 3.7% this year. the forecasts are based on ec predictions of gdp growth of 1.5% in germany next year and 2.2% in france.

berlin welcomed the decision, with finance minister hans eichel saying it showed that the ec recognised germany's fiscal policy was ""on the right track even amid very difficult economic conditions"". however paris was more subdued, with finance minister herve gaymard telling parliament: ""we must continue along this path of saving money."" however, the move still had its critics, with the european people's party (epp) attacking the ec for backing down from punitive action. ""the commission is buckling under the pressure from germany and france, "" epp spokesman alexander radwan said. ""the scary fact is that budget sinners, despite having repeatedly exceeded the 3% deficit limit, do not have to fear any sanctions."" despite the commission delivering its decision on the two biggest eurozone economies, it refused to comment on similar action against greece which has also broken the 3% deficit ceiling. monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said that it was a matter for next week.
","the european commission (ec) has called a truce in its battle with france and germany over breaching deficit limits.after announcing its decision to erase france and germany from its list of deficit rule breakers, the eu said that the time lag created by the ruling meant that 2005 should be the target year for the pair to bring their budget's below 3%.the forecasts are based on ec predictions of gdp growth of 1.5% in germany next year and 2.2% in france.france and germany will breach that this year.""the commission concludes that the two countries appear to be on track to correct their excessive deficits by 2005,"" it said in a statement.the move came after france and germany vowed to run their budget deficits below the eu cap in 2005 - for the first time in four years.under eu rules, member countries must keep their deficits below 3%.the eu expects the german deficit to fall to fall to 2.9% of gdp next year from 3.9% this year, while france's is forecast to drop to 3% from an expected 3.7% this year.",business,456,180

euro mp robert kilroy-silk has had a bucket of farm slurry thrown over him by a protester in manchester.

mr kilroy-silk had already been taken off air by bbc bosses for the comments, in which he also described arabs as ""limb-amputators, women repressors"". the remarks prompted outrage among muslim groups. the slurry attack took place on friday as mr kilroy-silk and ms kelly, a cabinet office minister and bolton west mp, arrived at manchester high school for girls for the recording of bbc radio 4's any questions.

the police were called but the attacker had disappeared by the time officers arrived. they are treating the incident as assault. the programme's host, jonathan dimbleby, later told the audience the mep had been covered from ""head to toe"". mr kilroy-silk was still able appear to appear on the show after being loaned a change of clothes.

he told reporters he was ""very angry"" and planned to press charges if his attacker was caught. he said the man shouted: ""you've offended my religion, i'm doing this in the name of islam."" ""as i started to turn round a guy tipped a bucket of farmyard muck over me and then threw the rest of it over me and the car,"" mr kilroy-silk said. ""i was totally covered, it was all through my clothes, and it stank to high heaven. it went all inside the car and splattered ruth kelly."" a bbc spokesman said: ""he took his seat as jonathan dimbleby was introducing the show. fortunately someone at the school had a change of clothes to let him have."" greater manchester police said people near mr kilroy-silk had also been hit by the waste. officers took statements at the scene, but no arrests have been made. police say the suspect ran off after towards wilmslow road after committing the offence but is believed to have been driving a red vauxhall corsa earlier. the suspect is described as white, aged 30 to 40, with a ginger beard. police want to hear from anyone who has any information.

mr kilroy-silk, an mep for the east midlands, resigned the uk independence party whip in the european parliament in october, after criticising ukip and stating his ambition to be leader. however, he remains a member of the party. he said on friday he hoped to be elected party leader before christmas. ""i think that is sufficient time for us to put in process what is necessary... in time for us to fight and have a significant impact upon the general election."" but a ukip spokesman said that would be impossible under the party's constitution, which requires 70 days before any leadership ballot can take place.

swiss cement firm holcim has bid $800m (â£429m) to buy two indian cement firms and a holding company in the country.

it plans to buy associated cement companies (acc), ambuja cement eastern and the holding firm, ambuja cement india ltd, a holcim statement said. shares in acc fell 5.5% as investors, who thought the offer was underpriced, decided to sell. meanwhile, uk-based firm aggregate industries said it had agreed a â£1.8bn takeover by holcim.

the deal with aggregates will give holcim, the world's second-biggest cement maker, an entry into the uk market and boost its presence in the us. peter tom, who will remain as aggregate chief executive, said the 138p a share offer provided ""significant value"" for shareholders. the markfield, leicestershire-based company runs 142 quarries in the uk and the us. it also has 164 ready-mixed concrete plants, 90 asphalt plants and 32 pre-cast concrete factories.

1616,"da vinci code is 'lousy history'

the plot of an international bestseller that thousands of readers are likely to receive as a christmas present is 'laughable', a clergyman has said.

the da vinci code claims jesus was not crucified, but married mary magdalene and died a normal death. it claims this was later covered up by the church. the bishop of durham, the rt rev dr tom wright, described the novel as a ""great thriller"" but ""lousy history"". the book has sold more than seven million copies worldwide. despite enjoying dan brown's conspiracy theory, the bishop said there was a lack of evidence to back up its claims.

writing his christmas message in the northern echo, the bishop said: ""conspiracy theories are always fun - fun to invent, fun to read, fun to fantasise about. ""dan brown is the best writer i've come across in the genre, but anyone who knows anything about 1st century history will see that this underlying material is laughable."" a great deal of credible evidence proves the biblical version of jesus' life was true, according to the bishop. ""the evidence for jesus and the origins of christianity is astonishingly good,"" he said. ""we have literally a hundred times more early manuscripts for the gospels and letters in the new testament than we have for the main classical authors like cicero, virgil and tacitus.

""historical research shows that they present a coherent and thoroughly credible picture of jesus, with all sorts of incidental details that fit the time when he lived, and don't fit the world of later legend."" brown's book has become a publishing phenomenon, consistently topping book charts in the uk and us. the da vinci code has been translated into 42 languages and has spawned its own cottage industry of publications, including guides on to how to read the book, rebuttals and counter claims. the book, which has become an international best-seller in little over two years, is set to be made into a film starring tom hanks.

""if you look at the oscars race, the aviator should be ahead,"" said awards pundit tom o'neil.

112,"lib dems target first-time buyers

the liberal democrats have unveiled plans to build 100,000 new ""affordable"" homes on publicly owned land.

the party's scheme would allow people to buy a share in a home through a mutual home ownership trust, as a way of getting onto the housing ladder. the lib dems would also encourage the conversion of existing buildings in an effort to protect greenfield sites. labour has already announced plans to help first-time buyers and the tories would extend right-to-buy schemes.

all the major parties are focusing on the issue in the run-up to the election after a survey suggested first-time buyers could not afford a home in 92% of uk towns. the lib dems say their ""mutual homes"" would let people buy a share of a property, usually worth about 5% of the building costs. party leader charles kennedy said the homes would be affordable because they would be built on surplus public sector land, donated by central or local government. people would also only have to pay for the cost of the building and not the land, he added.

they would spend about 30% of their monthly salary on rent and buying extra shares in the property. when they moved house, they would be able to cash in on any rise in property prices by selling their share. it would also allow councils to vary discounts to tenants given the right to buy their council homes so local needs were taken into account. mr kennedy said: ""mutual homes will offer people the opportunity to build up an equity stake in a home gradually, investing only as much as they can afford.""

there are also plans to prevent high house prices forcing people out of their local communities. the kind of ""golden share"" used by the lib dems in south shropshire could be rolled out more widely. under the plan, councils secure deals with developers where they keep a 1% share in a property scheme so properties cannot be sold on the open market. instead, they are sold at ""build cost"" to people who the local council decides have local needs. the party says its help for first-time buyers can be funded at no extra cost to the taxpayer. but the plans involve changing the vat system, which the party says often makes it too expensive to renovate existing buildings.

the conservatives claimed the plans would amount to an extra tax of up to â£11,000 on every new house. ""this is typical of lib dem hypocrisy,"" said tory shadow local government secretary caroline spelman. ""they claim that they want to help people on to the property ladder, but the small print of their policies reveal how they intend to price even more people out of the housing market."" the flagship tory proposal on housing policy is to give a million more housing association tenants the right to buy their homes. labour has said it will allow 300,000 council and housing association tenants to buy a share in their homes. housing minister keith hill said much of the lib dem plans mimicked the government's strategy. ""however, as usual, the lib dems' proposals are completely uncosted,"" he said. mr hill said he also asked whether the lib dems would match labour's promise to spend â£42bn on making refurbishing and repair council homes by 2010.

698,"bortolami predicts dour contest

italy skipper marco bortolami believes saturday's six nations contest against scotland will be a scrappy encounter.

with both sides looking for their first win of the championship, the third-round game at murrayfield has been billed as a wooden-spoon decider. and bortolami feels the edinburgh contest could end up being a bruising battle of the packs. ""it will not be a pretty game because both teams are desperate to gain their first win,"" said the lock forward. italy have only recorded three wins since they joined the six nations in 2000, but two of those have come against scotland. this year, italy opened up with a stubborn display against ireland but ended up losing 28-17.

""scotland played extremely well against france in paris but not so well when ireland came to edinburgh,"" said bortolami. ""we are still very disappointed with our last game against wales in rome and we are thoroughly determined to right the wrongs. ""as a nation, our quest is to be respected as a team worthy of a place in this tournament and we can only do this by winning games.""

marcel desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when chelsea take on barcelona on wednesday.

the french star was part of the chelsea side crushed 5-1 at the nou camp in the champions league quarter-final second leg in 2000. ""things will be totally different this time,"" he told bbc sport. ""now everyone knows about chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them. they are one of the major clubs in europe and the pressure will be on barcelona."" chelsea have not played barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. the blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at stamford bridge 3-1, courtesy of two goals from tore andre flo and one by gianfranco zola. but they collapsed in the second leg, going down to strikes from rivaldo (2), luis figo, dani and patrick kluivert.

former chelsea captain desailly, who is now playing for al-gharafa in qatar, says there is no comparison between that side and the current blues team, who are top of the premiership. ""mentally they are much stronger, even though a lot of their players are young,"" the 36-year-old said. ""we made some mistakes at the nou camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes. ""it would not happen now. this team has a new motivation and a different mentality."" world cup winner desailly saw huge changes during his time at stamford bridge. he was signed for â£4.6m from ac milan in 1998 by ruud gullit and went on to play under gianluca vialli and claudio ranieri. but the biggest change occurred when billionaire roman abramovich bought the club in 2003. desailly says the russian's arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. ""the whole of chelsea is different now - the chairman, the manager and all the players,"" he said.

""everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. ""since that game in 2000, chelsea have gained more experience in europe and were very close to reaching the champions league final last season."" desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. he won the 1998 world cup and 2000 european championship with france, the champions league in 1993 with marseilles and 1994 with ac milan, two serie a titles and the fa cup in 2000 with chelsea. he is now winding down his career in qatar, alongside the likes of frank lebeouf, josep guardiola, titi camara, gabriel batistuta and christophe dugarry. so he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against manchester united on wednesday - paolo maldini and alessandro costacurta. ""i'm happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level,"" he said. ""i made a vow to costacurta that as long as he plays, i will continue to play.

1742,"giant waves damage s asia economy

governments, aid agencies, insurers and travel firms are among those counting the cost of the massive earthquake and waves that hammered southern asia.

the worst-hit areas are sri lanka, india, indonesia and thailand, with at least 23,000 people killed. early estimates from the world bank put the amount of aid needed at about $5bn (â£2.6bn), similar to the cash offered central america after hurricane mitch. mitch killed about 10,000 people and caused damage of about $10bn in 1998. world bank spokesman damien milverton told the wall street journal that he expected an aid package of financing and debt relief.

tourism is a vital part of the economies of the stricken countries, providing jobs for 19 million people in the south east asian region, according to the world travel and tourism council (wttc). in the maldives islands, in the indian ocean, two-thirds of all jobs depend on tourism.

but the damage covers fishing, farming and businesses too, with hundreds of thousands of buildings and small boats destroyed by the waves. international agencies have pledged their support; most say it is impossible to gauge the extent of the damage yet. the international monetary fund (imf) has promised rapid action to help the governments of the stricken countries cope.

""the imf stands ready to do its part to assist these nations with appropriate support in their time of need,"" said managing director rodrigo rato. only sri lanka and bangladesh currently receive imf support, while indonesia, the quake's epicentre, has recently graduated from imf assistance. it is up to governments to decide if they want imf help. other agencies, such as the asian development bank, have said that it is too early to comment on the amount of aid needed. there is no underestimating the size of the problem, however. the united nations' emergency relief coordinator, jan egeland, said that ""this may be the worst national disaster in recent history because it is affecting so many heavily populated coastal areas... so many vulnerable communities. ""many people will have [had] their livelihoods, their whole future destroyed in a few seconds."" he warned that ""the longer term effects many be as devastating as the tidal wave or the tsunami itself"" because of the risks of epidemics from polluted drinking water.

insurers are also struggling to assess the cost of the damage, but several big players believe the final bill is likely to be less than the $27bn cost of the hurricanes that battered the us earlier this year.

""the region that's affected is very big so we have to check country-by-country what the situation is"", said serge troeber, deputy head of the natural disasters department at swiss re, the world's second biggest reinsurance firm. ""i should assume, however, that the overall dimension of insured damages is below the storm damages of the us,"" he said. munich re, the world's biggest reinsurer, said: ""this is primarily a human tragedy. it is too early for us to state what our financial burden will be."" allianz has said it sees no significant impact on its profitability. however, a low insurance bill may simply reflect the general poverty of much of the region, rather than the level of economic devastation for those who live there.

the international federation of the red cross and red crescent societies told the reuters news agency that it was seeking $6.5m for emergency aid.

""the biggest health challenges we face is the spread of waterborne diseases, particularly malaria and diarrhoea,"" the aid agency was quoted as saying. the european union has said it will deliver 3m euros (â£2.1m; $4.1m) of aid, according to the wall street journal. the eu's humanitarian aid commissioner, louis michel, was quoted as saying that it was key to bring aid ""in those vital hours and days immediately after the disaster"". other countries also are reported to have pledged cash, while the us state department said it was examining what aid was needed in the region. getting companies and business up and running also may play a vital role in helping communities recover from the weekend's events.

many of the worst-hit areas, such as sri lanka, thailand's phuket island and the maldives, are popular tourist resorts that are key to local economies.

december and january are two of the busiest months for the travel in southern asia and the damage will be even more keenly felt as the industry was only just beginning to emerge from a post 9/11 slump. growth has been rapid in southeast asia, with the world tourism organisation figures showing a 45% increase in tourist revenues in the region during the first 10 months of 2004. in southern asia that expansion is 23%. ""india continues to post excellent results thanks to increased promotion and product development, but also to the upsurge in business travel driven by the rapid economic development of the country,"" the wto said. ""arrivals to other destinations such as... maldives and sri lanka also thrived."" in thailand, tourism accounts for about 6% of the country's annual gross domestic product, or about $8bn. in singapore the figure is close to 5%. tourism also brings in much needed foreign currency. in the short-term, however, travel companies are cancelling flights and trips. that has hit shares across asia and europe, with investors saying that earnings and economic growth are likely to slow.

1022,"millions to miss out on the net

by 2025, 40% of the uk's population will still be without internet access at home, says a study.

around 23 million britons will miss out on a wide range of essential services such as education and medical information, predicts the report by telecoms giant bt. it compares to 27 million, or 50%, of the uk, who are not currently online. the idea that the digital divide will evaporate with time is ""wishful thinking"", the report concludes.

the study calls on the government and telecoms industry to come up with new ways to lure those that have been bypassed by the digital revolution. although the percentage of britons without home access will have fallen slightly, those that remain digital refuseniks will miss out on more, the report suggests. as more and more everyday tasks move online and offline services become less comprehensive, the divide will become more obvious and more burdensome for those that have not got net access, it predicts.

the gap between ""have-nets"" and ""have-nots"" has been much talked about, but predictions about how such a divide will affect future generations has been less discussed. bt set out to predict future patterns based on current information and taking account of the way technology is changing. optimists who predict that convergence and the emergence of more user-friendly technology will bridge the digital divide could be way off mark, the report suggests. ""internet access on other devices tends to be something taken up by those who already have it,"" said adrian hosford, director of corporate responsibility at bt. costs of internet access have fallen dramatically and coverage in remote areas have vastly improved over the last year but the real barrier remains psychological. ""there is a hard rump of have-nots who are not engaging with the net. they don't have the motivation or skills or perceive the benefits,"" said mr hosford.

as now, the most disadvantaged groups are likely to remain among low income families, the older generation and the disabled.

those on low incomes will account for a quarter of the digital have-nots, the disabled will make up 16% and the elderly nearly a third by 2025, the report forecasts. organisations such as bt have a responsibility to help tackle the problem, said mr hosford. the telco has seen positive results with its everybody online project which offers internet access to people in eight deprived communities around britain. in one area of cornwall with high levels of unemployment, online training helped people rewrite cvs and learn skills to get new jobs, explained mr hosford. such grassroot activity addressing the specific needs of individual communities is essential is the problem of the digital divide is to be overcome, he said. ""if we don't address this problem now, it will get a lot worse and people will find it more difficult to find jobs, education opportunities will be limited and they'll simply not be able to keep up with society,"" he said. the alliance for digital inclusion, an independent body with members drawn from government, industry and the voluntary sector has recently been set up to tackle some of the issues faced by the digital refuseniks.

japan's economy teetered on the brink of a technical recession in the three months to september, figures show.

revised figures indicated growth of just 0.1% - and a similar-sized contraction in the previous quarter. on an annual basis, the data suggests annual growth of just 0.2%, suggesting a much more hesitant recovery than had previously been thought. a common technical definition of a recession is two successive quarters of negative growth.

the government was keen to play down the worrying implications of the data. ""i maintain the view that japan's economy remains in a minor adjustment phase in an upward climb, and we will monitor developments carefully,"" said economy minister heizo takenaka. but in the face of the strengthening yen making exports less competitive and indications of weakening economic conditions ahead, observers were less sanguine.

traders at us banking giant citigroup are facing a criminal investigation in germany over a controversial bond deal.

385,"lord scarman, 93, dies peacefully

distinguished lawyer lord scarman, who conducted the inquiry into the 1981 brixton riots, has died aged 93.

the peer enjoyed a celebrated judicial career, serving as law commission chairman in its first seven years. he also chaired the 1969 tribunal set up to investigate civil disturbances in northern ireland. paying tribute, the lord chancellor lord falconer said lord scarman was one of the ""great advocates of our generation"".

""his legacy from his decisions in the lords and the court of appeal is substantial. ""his work in the wake of the brixton riots and his commitment to the vulnerable and dispossessed was second to none.

""a great judge, a great lawyer and a great man."" lord scarman's nephew george ritchie said the peer, who passed away peacefully on wednesday, would be ""sadly missed"".

the lord chief justice, lord woolf, who is the most senior judge in england and wales, said it was lord scarman's ""pioneering work"" which paved the way for the human rights act 1998. ""he was a lawyer and a judge who had a remarkable insight into human nature, and an exceptional sensitivity to the needs of a healthy society,"" he said. ""he was, personally, totally charming and he will be remembered with great affection and admiration by all who came into contact with him.""

dame elizabeth butler-sloss, the president of the family justice division, said lord scarman was a ""good and humane judge"" and one of the greatest figures of the late 20th century. lord scarman will be remembered for the public inquiry he led into a string of race riots which began in brixton when racial tensions rose after a police crackdown on street robbery. during the following three days of disturbances that spread to the midlands, merseyside, bristol and leeds, nearly 400 people were injured and buildings and vehicles were set alight.

the inquiry famously settled on the so-called ""rotten apples"" theory, which argued that only a few police officers were racist, saying most were not. it spawned new law enforcement practices and led to the creation of the police complaints authority. trevor phillips, chair of the commission for racial equality, praised lord scarman's ""ability to listen"". he said: ""when lord scarman toured the streets of brixton his presence was electrifying. ""a community which had been systematically ignored by everyone else was suddenly embraced by the epitome of the english establishment.

705,"houllier praises benitez regime

former liverpool manager gerard houllier has praised the work of his anfield successor rafael benitez.

houllier was angry at reports that he has been critical of benitez since the spaniard took over at liverpool. but houllier told bbc sport: ""in private and in public, i have stressed i believe rafa is doing a good job. he is the right man at the right place. ""rafa is a good coach and a good man. i've spoken to him since he has been at liverpool and never criticised him."" houllier also revealed he is now ready to return to the game after leaving liverpool in may following six years at anfield.

the former france boss has been linked with a host of jobs and pulled out of the race to succeed mark hughes as wales national coach. he has been working for uefa, covering the premiership for french television and also coaching in brazil with national coach carlos alberto perreira. houllier said: ""if a good club comes up at the right time then yes, i am ready to come back. ""it has been interesting to watch games from a different perspective and i have learned things. ""i have been involved in football since leaving liverpool and my batteries are recharged.""

houllier has been impressed with the quality in the premiership after watching as a pundit - particularly with jose mourinho's work at leaders chelsea. he said: ""chelsea are doing very well. they have some very good creative players in damien duff and arjen robben and didier drogba showed he can change the face of a game when he came on against newcastle. ""they have got a good team spirit and are strong mentally. they have shown they can cope with all the pressure put on them because of the expectations and cope well with jose's principles. ""jose had results before he came to chelsea and i think he will have an impact in the premiership because he manages his team very cleverly."" and houllier, away from his brief at liverpool, has been hugely impressed with the premiership. he said: ""it is a very exciting league. it is entertaining, goals are scored and teams are always trying to win. ""it has been very interesting to watch the game from a different perspective. ""games switch from end-to-end and there is more pace to the premiership than other leagues. it is a very good product.""

701,"taylor poised for scotland return

simon taylor has been named in the scotland squad for saturday's six nations clash with italy.

the 25-year-old number eight made a scoring return for edinburgh at the weekend - his first game in a year for the capital side. taylor suffered knee ligament damage playing against ireland in dublin in the 2004 six nations championship. ""simon is one of scotland's truly world class players so it is a huge bonus,"" said team-mate chris paterson. ""he brings a whole new dimension to us, especially in defence and his ability to slow the opposition ball down could be key against italy if he is involved."" taylor has turned out for english side saracens in recent weeks during a short-term loan to improve his fitness.

edinburgh were not in action during the first two weeks of this season's six nations. so taylor played the last 20 minutes of saracens' win over northampton and then 40 minutes in a friendly against south african super 12 side the cats. scotland coach matt williams is due to name his match-day 22 on thursday. both scotland and italy have lost their opening two six nations games and, just like last season's encounter which italy won, this weekend's game could turn out to be a battle to avoid the wooden spoon.

1110,"mobile games come of age

the bbc news website takes a look at how games on mobile phones are maturing. a brief round-up follows but you can skip straight to the reviews by clicking on the links below. part two will follow on monday.

reviews of call of duty, splinter cell - pandora tomorrow, lord of the rings and pocket kingdom will follow on monday if you think of snake when some mentions ""mobile games"" then you could be in for a bit of a surprise. this is because mobile games have come a long way in a very short time. even before nokia's n-gage game phone launched in late 2003, many mobile operators were realising that there was an audience looking for something to play on their handset.

and given that many more people own handsets than own portable game playing gadgets such as the gameboy it could be a very lucrative market. that audience includes commuters wanting something to fill their time on the way home, game fans looking for a bit of variety and hard core gamers who like to play every moment they can. life for all these types of player has got immeasurably better in the last year as the numbers of titles you can download to your phone has snowballed. now sites such as wireless gaming review list more than 200 different titles for some uk networks and the ranges suit every possible taste. there are ports of pc and arcade classics such as space invaders, lunar lander and bejewelled. there are also versions of titles, such as colin mcrae rally, that you typically find on pcs and consoles.

there are shoot-em-ups, adventure games, strategy titles and many novel games only found on handsets. rarely now does an action movie launch without a mobile game tie-in. increasingly such launches are all part of the promotional campaign for a film, understandable when you realise that a good game can rack up millions of downloads. the returns can be pretty good when you consider that some games cost â£5. what has also helped games on mobiles thrive is the fact that it is easier than ever to get hold of them thanks to technology known as wap push. by sending a text message to a game maker you can have the title downloaded to your handset. far better than having to navigate through the menus of most mobile operator portals. the number of handsets that can play games has grown hugely too. almost half of all phones now have java onboard meaning that they can play the increasingly sophisticated games that are available - even the ones that use 3d graphics.

the minimum technology specifications that phones should adhere to are getting more sophisticated which means that games are too. now double key presses are possible making familiar tactics such as moving and strafing a real option. the processing power on handsets means that physics on mobile games is getting more convincing and the graphics are improving too. some game makers are also starting to take advantage of the extra capabilities in a mobile. many titles, particularly racing games, let you upload your best time to see how you compare to others. usually you can get hold of their best time and race against a ""ghost"" or ""shadow"" to see if you can beat them. a few games also let you take on people in real time via the network or, if you are sitting close to them, via bluetooth short-range radio technology. with so much going on it is hard to do justice to the sheer diversity of what is happening. but these two features should help point you in the direction of the game makers and give you an idea of where to look and how to get playing.

too fast too furious (digital bridges)

as soon as i start playing this i remember why i never play driving games - because i'm rubbish at them. no matter if i drive the car via joystick or keypad i just cannot get the hang of braking for corners or timing a rush to pass other drivers. the game rewards replay because to advance you have to complete every section within a time limit. winning gives you cash for upgrades. graphically the rolling road is a convincing enough evocation of speed as the palm trees and cactus whip by and the city scrolls past in the background. the cars handle pretty well despite my uselessness but it was not clear if the different models of cars were appreciably different on the track. the only niggle was that the interface was a bit confusing especially when using a joystick rather than the keypad to play.

fatal force (macrospace)

a futuristic shooter that lets you either play various deathmatch modes against your phone or run through a series of scenarios that involves killing aliens invading earth. graphics are a bit cartoon-like but only helps to make clear what is going on and levels are well laid out and encourage you to leap about exploring. both background music and sounds effects work well. the scenarios are well scripted and you regularly get hints from the fatal force commanders. weapons include flamethrowers, rocket launchers, grenades and at a couple of points you even get chance to use a mech for a short while. with the right power-up you can go into a matrix-style bullet time to cope with the onslaught of aliens. the game lets you play via bluetooth if others are in range. online the game has quite a following with clans, player rankings and even new downloadable maps.

double olympic champion kelly holmes was back to her best as she comfortably won the 1,000m at the norwich union birmingham indoor grand prix.

the 34-year-old, running only her second competitive race of the season, shook off the rust to win in two minutes, 35.39 seconds. but she is still undecided about competing in the european championships in madrid from 4-6 march. ""i'll probably be entered and make my mind up at the last minute,"" she said. ""my training hasn't gone as well as expected but i've got two weeks to decide.

mr kennedy said during his nearly 22 years in parliament he had seen prime ministers and party leaders come and go and knew the pitfalls of british politics. ""1983 was when i was first elected as an mp - so tony blair, michael howard and myself were all class of '83 - and over that nearly quarter of a century the world has changed out of recognition,"" he said.

950,"mobile music challenges 'ipod age'

nokia and microsoft have agreed a deal to work on delivery of music to handsets, while sony ericsson has unveiled its phone walkman and motorola is working on an itunes phone.

can mobile phones replace the mp3 player in your pocket? the music download market has been growing steadily since record firms embraced digital distribution. ease of use, relative low price and increased access to broadband has helped drive the phenomenal growth of mp3 players.

full-length music downloads on mobile phones have not taken off so quickly - held back by technical challenges as well as issues over music availability. but the mobile music industry is confident that the days of dedicated mp3 players are numbered.

gilles babinet, chief executive of mobile music firm musiwave, said: ""music downloads on mobiles have the potential to be the biggest-ever medium for music.""

musiwave provides downloading infrastructure for the mobile phone market and mr babinet said the industry was enjoying ""definite momentum."" but there are hurdles to overcome. mobile phones offer limited storage for music - certainly nothing to rival apple's 60gb ipod. but the first mobile phones with hard disk players will be on the market soon and the current generation of mobiles using flash technology can store up to one gigabyte of music - enough for 250 songs. ""we are working in the hard disk area and we will be bringing out exciting devices,"" jonas guest, vice president for entertainment at nokia, told the bbc news website. but will mobiles become mere storage devices? ""one of the problems we could have is that mobiles are used just for storage and playback while pcs are used for downloading,"" said mr babinet

""we don't want people to cast aside their pcs - we want mobile users to hook up into the existing ecosystems,"" explained mr guest. ""you must enable people to transfer music from a pc to a handset and vice versa.""

one of the key elements of the nokia and microsoft deal is the agreed ability to transfer songs between a handset and a pc. microsoft will adopt open standards allowing music to cross boundaries for the first time. songs can be downloaded on pc or mobile and transferred between the platforms. ""the line between online and wireless is going to blur,"" predicted ted cohen, senior vice president of digital development and distribution at emi. he said: ""the market is more regional in its maturity. in asia it is beyond belief. ""the majority of our digital revenues in asia comes from mobiles. in north america it is fixed line while there is equilibrium in europe.""

emi currently offers its entire 200,000 download catalogue for use by both by pcs and mobile phones. mr cohen said: ""it's going to be just as important to connect through 3g or wireless as it is through your pc. ""we want music to be a continuum."" the seamless experience of mobiles and pc downloads is approaching, he predicted. mr babinet said the mobile phone had a number of advantages over pcs which would see it become the focus for music downloading in the future. ""getting music from your pc onto a device is not an easy experience. you have to switch the pc on, load the operating system, load the program, buy the music, download the music, and then transfer the music. ""all of these steps can be done in one step on a mobile phone."" he said the mobile phone's billing system would make it easier for teenagers to embrace downloads, because pre-paid cards were already accepted by the age group.

""certainly, we have a problem with battery, memory and bandwidth. but it's not about the current status. it's about the potential.

326,"howard and blair tax pledge clash

tony blair has said voters will have to wait for labour's manifesto to see if the party has plans to increase tax.

the premier was responding to a challenge from tory leader michael howard who said labour would raise taxes in its post-election budget. mr blair derided tory claims they could cut â£35bn in ""wasteful spending"" saying the party had got its sums wrong. the two political leaders clashed just days after the opening salvoes of the pre-election period. mr howard told mps that ""every independent expert"" from the international monetary fund to the institute of fiscal studies had suggested the ""government was spending more than it is raising and a labour chancellor would have to put up taxes"". mr blair replied: ""i think they are wrong for this very simple reason: that the treasury forecasts on the economy have been proven right."" the tories on monday highlighted their plans for tax cuts worth â£4bn, although the specific taxes to be cut have not been announced.

they also spelled out their plans for reduced government borrowing and more spending on key services. labour and the liberal democrats have said the party's sums do not add up and claim it would cut frontline services. but mr howard said voters faced a clear choice at the next election between more waste and more tax under labour and tory value for money and lower taxes. the liberal democrats have also launched their pre-election platform, with leader charles kennedy saying his party was the ""authentic opposition"", particularly on the iraq war, council tax and university tuition fees. labour hit back at the tory proposals even before their publication with election coordinator alan milburn accusing mr howard of producing a ""fraudulent prospectus"".

2117,"german economy rebounds

germany's economy, the biggest among the 12 countries sharing the euro, grew at its fastest rate in four years during 2004, driven by strong exports.

gross domestic product (gdp) rose by 1.7% last year, the statistical office said. the economy contracted in 2003. foreign sales increased by 8.2% last year, compared with a 0.3% slide in private consumption. concerns remain, however, over the strength of the euro, weak domestic demand and a sluggish labour market. the european central bank (ecb) left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 2% on thursday. it is the nineteenth month in a row that the ecb has not moved borrowing costs. economists predict that an increase is unlikely to come until the second half of 2005, with growth set to sputter rather than ignite.

""during 2004 we profited from the fact that the world economy was strong,"" said stefan schilbe, analyst at hsbc trinkaus & burkhardt. ""if exports weaken and domestic growth remains poor, we cannot expect much from 2005."" many german consumers have been spooked and unsettled by government attempts to reform the welfare state and corporate environment. major companies including volkswagen, daimlerchrysler and siemens have spent much of 2004 in tough talks with unions about trimming jobs and costs. they have also warned there are more cost cutting measures on the horizon.

the body that represents the us movie industry has released its latest tool in its campaign to clamp down on movie file-sharing, aimed at parents.

the movie association for america's (mpaa) free parent file scan software lets parents check their children's computers for peer-to-peer programs. it will also list all movie and music files they have on their hard drive. parents then have the choice to remove programs and files. the mpaa said files found would not be passed on to it. ""our ultimate goal is to help consumers locate the resources and information they need to make appropriate decisions about using and trading illegal files,"" said dan glickman, mpaa chief. ""many parents are concerned about what their children have downloaded and where they've downloaded it from.""

but some computer users who had tested the latest software reported on some technology sites that the program had identified windows default wav files as copyrighted material and wanted to delete them. movie piracy cost the industry â£3.7bn ($7bn) in 2003, according to analysts. the mpaa said in a statement that it would continue to provide easy access to similar tools in the coming months to combat ""the deleterious effects of peer-to-peer software, including such common problems as viruses, trojan horses and identity theft"".

mr glickman said that the film industry was embracing ""digital age technologies"", like movielink and cinemanow, which are legal movie sites. ""but legal services such as these need a chance to grow and thrive without having to compete against illegitimate operations that depend on stolen property to survive,"" he added. the industry body also said it had launched a second round of legal action against online movie-swappers across the us, but did not say how many were being sued. its first set of lawsuits were filed in november 2004. it also started a campaign against operators of bittorrent, edonkey and directconnect peer-to-peer networks. the first convictions for peer-to-peer piracy were handed out in the us in january. william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music, movies and software.

1032,"global blogger action day called

the global web blog community is being called into action to lend support to two imprisoned iranian bloggers.

the month-old committee to protect bloggers' is asking those with blogs to dedicate their sites on 22 february to the ""free mojtaba and arash day"". arash sigarchi and mojtaba saminejad are both in prison in iran. blogs are free sites through which people publish thoughts and opinions. iranian authorities have been clamping down on prominent sites for some time. ""i hope this day will focus people,"" curt hopkins, director of the committee, told the bbc news website.

the group has a list of actions which it says bloggers can take, including writing to local iranian embassies. the committee has deemed tuesday ""free mojtaba and arash day"" as part of its first campaign. it is calling on the blogsphere - the name for the worldwide community of bloggers - to do what it can to help raise awareness of the plight of mojtaba and arash as well as other ""cyber-dissidents"". ""if you have a blog, the least you could do is put nothing on that blog except 'free mojtaba and arash day',"" said mr hopkins. ""that would mean you could see that phrase 7.1 million times. that alone will shine some light on the situation. ""if you don't have one, find one dedicated to that - it takes about 30 seconds."" technorati, a blog search engine, tracks about six million blogs and says that more than 12,000 are added daily. a blog is created every 5.8 seconds, according to a us research think-tank.

the committee to protect bloggers was started by us blogger curt hopkins and counts fired flight attendant blogger ellen simonetti as a deputy director. she has since started the international bloggers' bill of rights, a global petition to protect bloggers at work. although not the only website committed to human rights issues by any means, it aims to be the hub or organisation, information and support for bloggers in particular and their rights to freedom of speech.

the committee, although only a month old, aims to be the focal point for blogger action on similar issues in the future, and will operate as a non-for-profit organisation. ""blogging is in this weird no man's land. people think of it as being one thing or another depending on their point of view,"" said mr hopkins. ""some think of themselves as pundits, kind of like journalists, and some like me have a private blog which is just a publishing platform. ""but they do not have a constituency and are out there in the cold.""

it is not just human rights issues in countries which have a track record of restricting what is published in the media that is of concern to bloggers. the question of bloggers and what rights they have to say what they want on their sites is a thorny one and has received much press attention recently. high profile cases in which employees have been sacked for what they have said on their personal, and often anonymous blogs, have highlighted the muddy situation that the blogsphere is currently in.

""this is a big messy argument,"" explained mr hopkins. he added: ""it is just such a new way of doing business, there will be clamp downs."" but the way these issues get tested is through the courts which, said mr hopkins, ""is part of the whole messy conversation."" ""if you haven't already got bloggers in your company, you will have them tomorrow - and if you don't have a blogger policy now you had better start looking at having one. mr hopkins said that the blogsphere - which is doubling every five months - was powerful because it takes so little time and expertise to create a blog. ""everyone does this - mums, radicals, conservatives,"" he said. many companies offer easy-to-use services to create a blog and publish it in minutes to a global community. ""that is the essential difference. what i call 'templating software' gives every single person on earth the chance to have one. ""you don't even have to have your own computer.""

2027,"iraqi voters turn to economic issues

beyond the desperate security situation in iraq lies an economy in tatters.

a vicious cycle of unemployment, poor social services and poverty has been made worse by a lack of investment. so there is much hope that an elected government will break the deadlock. ""first rule of law, then the economy,"" says radwan hadi, deputy managing director of aberdeen-based oil and gas consultancy blackwatch petroleum services, which entered iraq in 2003. mr hadi's view about what the new government's priorities should be is shared by many iraqis. the economy has become the second-most dominant issue for many political parties ahead of sunday's election, according to bristol university political scientist anne alexander, who is working on a project that looks at governance and security in post-war iraq.

job creation ranks high both on election manifestos and on the iraqi people's wish list. nobody knows exactly how many iraqis are out of work, but it is clear that the situation is dire. ""estimates of iraq's unemployment rate vary, but we estimate it to be between 30-40%,"" the washington-based independent think-tank the brookings institution says in its iraq index. but some progress has been made, largely thanks to the country's oil revenues which have exceeded $22bn since june 2003.

iraq's infrastructure is on the mend, with notable improvements having been made in areas such as electricity supply, irrigation, telephone networks and the re-opening of hospitals. but serious problems remain and the growing divide between haves and have-nots is angering voters. one iraqi woman told ms alexander about her frustration as she watched tv adverts for private hospitals soon after having failed to track down basic medicines from baghdad's pharmacies. observes mr hadi: ""the economy at present marks a big divide; the rich get richer, the poor get poorer."" an indication of this can be seen in the world of finance where, in contrast with the daily plight of ordinary people, 19 private banks operate, only one of which is run in accordance with islamic banking principles. hopes are high for the future of finance, so foreign banks have been buying into the sector. national bank of kuwait has bought a majority stake in credit bank of iraq, the jordanian investment bank export & finance bank has bought 49% of national bank of iraq.

foreign firms also hope to cash in on the reconstruction effort. bechtel's efforts to rebuild schools and restore power have attracted controversy as well as boosting its bottom line while halliburton has enjoyed a wealth of military contracts. but the involvement of foreign firms in the health and banking sectors and beyond sits uneasily with many iraqis who are accustomed to the state taking responsibility for functions that are essential to making society work, observes ms alexander. ""it is seen as a selling off of iraq's assets and bringing in multinationals at the expense of iraqi businesses and iraqi workers,"" she says. consequently, the transitional government has been forced to backtrack in recent months over its proposal to allow 100% foreign ownership of iraqi assets, she explains. in the west, it is easy to forget that the otherwise brutal baathist regime used to look after the majority of iraq's citizens rather well in terms of job creation, social security and healthcare. opinion polls suggest that ""people still want the state to take a leading role in providing these things"", ms alexander says.

yet in some areas of the economy, investment from abroad is still warmly welcomed, insists mr hadi, an iraqi who left the country three decades ago. ""i think the private sector will evolve incredibly fast,"" mr hadi says. ""iraq's vast natural resources can support any magnitude of economic growth.""

many foreign companies say they are keen to get in on the act, yet few are actually entering the country in any meaningful way. but there are exceptions. mr hadi's blackwatch is just one of many small operators preparing for a much bigger future. blackwatch's baghdad-based affiliate falcon group has dozens of people working for it across the country in kirkuk and baghdad, and its engineers and geo-scientists work with the iraqi oil ministry to hammer out technology transfer issues, mr hadi points out. ""these guys are trying to work. the iraqi business people will do business at all times. ""life goes on in iraq, the people take responsibility, they want to live normal lives.""

271,"guantanamo man 'suing government'

a british terror suspect held in guantanamo bay for 33 months plans to sue the government, it is reported.

martin mubanga claimed in the observer that an mi6 officer played a key role in consigning him to the us camp in cuba, following his arrest in zambia. mr mubanga, 32, from wembley, london, said he was brutally interrogated and daubed with urine at the camp. the home secretary said he would not be launching an investigation and that the media reports were not ""well informed"". mr mubanga, who has dual british and zambian nationality, was one of four britons who were released from the us camp in january.

he said he was sent there after being interrogated by a british man who said he was from mi6, shortly after his arrest in zambia in march 2002. mr mubanga said he had been in afghanistan and pakistan to study islam. but he said he was unable to return to the uk because he had lost his british passport, and was travelling on his zambian passport instead. mr mubanga said the ""mi6 agent"" told him the passport had been found in a cave in afghanistan along with documents listing jewish groups in new york and suggested he had been on an al-qaeda reconnaissance mission. mr mubanga said the man, and an american female defence official, tried to recruit him as an agent, but he refused and within three weeks was told he would be sent to guantanamo bay.

his lawyer louise christian said: ""'we are hoping to issue proceedings for the misfeasance of officials who colluded with the americans in effectively kidnapping him and taking him to guantanamo."" and menzies campbell, the liberal democrats' foreign affairs spokesman, said it was vital to establish whether ministers approved mr mubanga's transfer to guantanamo. but a foreign office spokesman said he could not comment on the activities of british intelligence or security agencies. and home secretary charles clarke told bbc one's breakfast with frost: ""i'm not organising a specific investigation into it."" mr mubanga is the first of the four detainees freed last month to give a media interview. he told the observer his worst moment was when he was told he would be released last march, only to be confined and told he would be there for many more years.

he claimed he was stripped of his clothes and mattress and forced to remain in an empty metal box, naked except for boxer shorts. and he said an interrogator used a mop to daub him with his own urine while he was chained hand and foot. mr mubanga, who insists he does not feel bitter, said: ""i've lost three years of my life, because i was a muslim. he added: ""the authorities wanted to break me but they strengthened me. they've made me what i am - even if i'm not quite sure yet who that person is."" the us government denied the claims, saying it condemned and prohibited torture. in a statement, it said: ""the department of defense has no doubt that mr mubanga was properly detained as an enemy combatant under the laws of war. ""he was detained to prevent him from fighting against the us and our allies in the war on terror."" but fair trials abroad director stephen jakobi said there were similarities between mr mubanga's account and those of other guantanamo detainees. he said: ""the pattern is the same. the real problem is the concentration camp conditions in guantanamo. ""is [charles clarke] really pretending this is all made up?"" mr mubanga and the three other freed british detainees were released without charge by uk police on their return from cuba.

rob hoadley returned to haunt his old club at the madejski stadium, scoring the opening try in the 43rd minute. tom voyce powered through the irish defence for wasps' second try before richard birkett went over unchallenged. mark van gisbergen added 18 points. irish replied with three penalties and a mark mapletoft drop goal before scott staniforth ran in a consolation try. barry everitt, who replaced mapletoft late in the game, added the conversion to become the fourth premiership player to reach 1,000 points. he joins jonny wilkinson, tim stimpson and paul grayson in achieving that target. wasps piled on the pressure in an attempt to grab a fourth try which would have secured them a bonus point, but they were denied by some desperate defending from irish. director of rugby warren gatland revealed that harsh words at half-time inspired his wasps side to raise their game after the restart.

""they got a roasting and it was a good second-half performance when they came out and played to instructions,"" he said. gatland also singled out stand-in flankers tom rees and john hart for special praise. ""they did very well. the back row played some fantastic rugby,"" he added. london irish coach gary gold felt the result exposed his side's lack of consistency.

irish trailed by just two points at the break and gold said: ""for 55 minutes we lived with the best but we have got to get back for the full 80 minutes."" gold will now turn his attention to next week's powergen cup semi-final at struggling leeds. ""we've got a good chance but with leeds facing possible relegation they're going to come out firing,"" he added.

1013,"chip maker backs net phone calls

rich templeton, the head of giant chip maker texas instruments, has given his backing to the growing sector of voice over internet telephony (voip)

voip allows pc users, and in some cases those with just a broadband connection, to make telephone calls via the net. mr templeton said voip would be the next major application to drive broadband connections into homes. internet service provider wanadoo has announced it is launching its own broadband telephony service in the uk.

subscribers to wanadoo's broadband service will be able to use the service to make free evening and weekend calls to any uk landline, and free calls at any time to other wanadoo users. the service will cost an extra â£4 a month and will come with a free livebox, the broadband hub which wanadoo plans will be used in future to provide video-on-demand and home security services. the secondary phone line will mean customers can have an extra home phone number and will also provide wireless internet access around the home. eventually the service will replace existing landline services as wanadoo goes head to head with bt. ""voice-over broadband is a key trend across europe and is set to have a dramatic impact on the telecommunications industry, "" eric abensur, wanadoo's chief executive told the bbc news website. mr templeton said he agreed. ""voice-over-packet is going to be the second killer application after broadband internet access,"" he said. the world's largest maker of chips for mobile phones believes the technology will grow rapidly from the relatively small user base it has currently.

almost 83 million people have downloaded the software that powers the skype voip service, according to the net telephony firm's website. skype lets people make free calls to other skype users and also make low-cost calls to ordinary phone numbers. us firm vonage also offers a voip service, but one which lets people plug an ordinary phone into a broadband router to make calls. bill simmelink, general manager of ti's voip business, said the technology would only take off when people were making net calls with the ease of making a normal call. ""it's not about the pipe, if you will, or the silicon per se, it's about the application,"" he said.

""we want to communicate freely, effortlessly and economically wherever we are."" in a sign that voip is seeping into the mainstream, giant isp aol announced on tuesday that it had plans to launch a net-based phone service for some of its members within the month. customers will continue to use their traditional phones, but they will plug them into adapters connected to their broadband source rather than the jack provided by the telephone company. calls are received and placed just like on the old telephone network. ""we can help mass-market adoption of voip,"" said aol chief executive jonathan miller. ""we can utilise our national footprint. we can help the entire industry become well known.""

four people died when a section of rail broke and a high speed train derailed. balfour beatty's railway maintenance arm was in charge of the upkeep of the line at hatfield, hertfordshire. balfour beatty managers anthony walker and nicholas jeffries, and railtrack managers alistair cook, sean fugill and keith lea all face individual charges. all five men, along with four others, are also accused of breaches of health and safety laws. balfour beatty rail maintenance faces a corporate manslaughter charge. it is expected the trial could last as long as a year. the accident, on 17 october 2000, happened when the london to leeds express came off the tracks at 115 mph, when it was derailed by a cracked section of rail. the accident on the east coast main line sparked major disruption. the overall responsibility for the line was railtrack's - the company that has now become network rail. those who died in the accident were steve arthur, 46, from pease pottage, west sussex; peter monkhouse, 50, of headingley, leeds; leslie gray, 43, of tuxford, nottingham; and robert james alcorn, 37, of auckland, new zealand.

1873,"palestinian economy in decline

despite a short-lived increase in palestinian jobs in 2003, the economy is performing well below its potential, said a world bank report.

unemployment stood at 25%, compared with 10% before the uprising against israeli occupation four years ago. young people are particularly hard hit with 37% out of work, compared with 14% four years ago. but 104,000 new jobs were created last year during a brief easing of violence and closures. however, during the first half of this year, the palestinian economy lost more than 22,000 jobs. last year's growth rate of 6% can also be attributed to this temporary gap in violence, the report said. according to the report, intifada, closures and palestinian economic crisis: an assessment, there is a close link between the number of closures - both border closures and internal closures between cities - and palestinian economic problems. the closures arranged by israel restrict the movement of palestinian people and goods, slowing down trade.

""closures are a key factor behind today's economic crisis in the west bank,"" said nigel roberts, world bank country director for the west bank and gaza. nearly half of all palestinians - some 47% - live below the poverty line and are particularly vulnerable to economic shocks. the report said even more would be on the poverty line without an average of $950m a year from international donors, some of which goes towards job creation. it also called on the palestinian authority to revive its reform programme and maintain financial discipline to create an investment-friendly climate. this week colin powell, us secretary of state was visiting the west bank to stress us support for a smooth palestinian election in january.

1265,"robots learn 'robotiquette' rules

robots are learning lessons on ""robotiquette"" - how to behave socially - so they can mix better with humans.

by playing games, like pass-the-parcel, a university of hertfordshire team is finding out how future robot companions should react in social situations. the study's findings will eventually help humans develop a code of social behaviour in human-robot interaction. the work is part of the european cogniron robotics project, and was on show at london's science museum.

""we are assuming a situation in which a useful human companion robot already exists,"" said professor kerstin dautenhahn, project leader at hertfordshire. ""our mission is to look at how such a robot should be programmed to respect personal spaces of humans.""

the research also focuses on human perception of robots, including how they should look, and how a robot can learn new skills by imitating a human demonstrator. ""without such studies, you will build robots which might not respect the fact that humans are individuals, have preferences and come from different cultural backgrounds,"" professor dautenhahn told bbc news online. ""and i want robots to treat humans as human beings, and not like other robots,"" she added.

in most situations, a companion robot will eventually have to deal not only with one person, but also with groups of people. to find out how they would react, the hertfordshire cogniron team taught one robot to play pass-the-parcel with children.

showing off its skills at the science museum, the unnamed robot had to select, approach, and ask different children to pick up a parcel with a gift, moving it arm as a pointer and its camera as an eye. it even used speech to give instructions and play music. however, according to researchers, it will still take many years to build a robot which would make full use of the ""robotiquette"" for human interaction. ""if you think of a robot as a companion for the human being, you can think of 20 years into the future,"" concluded professor dautenhahn. ""it might take even longer because it is very, very hard to develop such a robot.""

2075,"dollar gains on greenspan speech

the dollar has hit its highest level against the euro in almost three months after the federal reserve head said the us trade deficit is set to stabilise.

and alan greenspan highlighted the us government's willingness to curb spending and rising household savings as factors which may help to reduce it. in late trading in new york, the dollar reached $1.2871 against the euro, from $1.2974 on thursday. market concerns about the deficit has hit the greenback in recent months. on friday, federal reserve chairman mr greenspan's speech in london ahead of the meeting of g7 finance ministers sent the dollar higher after it had earlier tumbled on the back of worse-than-expected us jobs data. ""i think the chairman's taking a much more sanguine view on the current account deficit than he's taken for some time,"" said robert sinche, head of currency strategy at bank of america in new york. ""he's taking a longer-term view, laying out a set of conditions under which the current account deficit can improve this year and next.""

worries about the deficit concerns about china do, however, remain. china's currency remains pegged to the dollar and the us currency's sharp falls in recent months have therefore made chinese export prices highly competitive. but calls for a shift in beijing's policy have fallen on deaf ears, despite recent comments in a major chinese newspaper that the ""time is ripe"" for a loosening of the peg. the g7 meeting is thought unlikely to produce any meaningful movement in chinese policy. in the meantime, the us federal reserve's decision on 2 february to boost interest rates by a quarter of a point - the sixth such move in as many months - has opened up a differential with european rates. the half-point window, some believe, could be enough to keep us assets looking more attractive, and could help prop up the dollar. the recent falls have partly been the result of big budget deficits, as well as the us's yawning current account gap, both of which need to be funded by the buying of us bonds and assets by foreign firms and governments. the white house will announce its budget on monday, and many commentators believe the deficit will remain at close to half a trillion dollars.

1741,"yangtze electric's profits double

yangtze electric power, the operator of china's three gorges dam, has said its profits more than doubled in 2004.

the firm has benefited from increased demand for electricity at a time when power shortages have hit cities and provinces across the country. as a hydroelectric-power generator it has not been hurt by higher coal costs. net income jumped to 3bn yuan in 2004 ($365m; â£190m), compared with 1.4bn yuan in 2003. sales surged to 6.2bn yuan, from 3bn yuan a year earlier. the figures topped analysts expectations, even though the rate of growth has slowed from 2003. analysts forecast that it is likely to decline further this year to a rate of expansion of closer to 20%.

yangtze electric has been expanding its output to meet demand driven by china's booming economy. the government has delayed the building of a number of power plants in an effort to rein in growth amid concerns that the economy may overheat. that has led to an energy crunch, with demand outstripping supply. earlier this month, work was halted on an underground power station, and a supply unit on the three gorges dam, as well as a power station on its sister xiluodu dam because of environmental worries. a total of 30 large-scale projects have been halted across the country for similar reasons. the three gorges dam project has led to more than half a million people being relocated and drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. its sister project, the xiluodu dam, is being built on the jinshajiang - or ""river of golden sand"" as the upper reaches of the yangtze are known.

eight out of 10 voters do not trust politicians to tell the truth, a new poll conducted for the bbc suggests.

and 87% of the 1,000 adults quizzed by icm for bbc news 24 said politicians did not deliver what they promised. the poll comes after foreign secretary jack straw predicted trust would be ""the key choice"" at the next election. both the tories and the lib dems are keen to emphasise a perceived lack of trust in tony blair, following his claims over iraqi weapons.

but according to the bbc poll, 61% said the issue of trust made no difference to whether or not they would vote at the next election, widely expected on 5 may. the poll also looked at what lay behind the lack of trust in politicians. some 87% said politicians did not keep the promises they made before elections, while 92% said they never gave ""a straight answer"". just under three-quarters of respondents (73%) said politicians had shown themselves to be dishonest too often.

mr straw told activists in blackburn on thursday that voters would have to decide at the next election which party ""best deserves"" their ""future trust"". ""that in the end is the key choice at the next election.""

he acknowledged that the public had lost faith in labour, but suggested it could persuade people to ""reinvest their trust with us"" if the party could overcome tory attempts to spread cynicism in politics. the conservatives are keen to highlight the trust issue. during his response to gordon brown's budget statement on tuesday, michael howard compared the chancellor's figures to the prime minister's claims about iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

the lib dems are also keen to highlight the trust issue, with charles kennedy has claiming voters had a ""fundamental lack of trust in the prime minister"". and the green party unveiled a billboard opposite the palace of westminster accusing the government of lying over the iraq war.

former education secretary estelle morris told bbc news 24 that there was a ""real problem of trust"" between the public and the politicians. she said she did not feel her own colleagues could be trusted, but suggested the ""three-cornered relationship"" between the press, politicians and the public had a hand in the issue. the public was often turned off by sitting on the sidelines in ""the battle of words"" between the politician and the journalist, she added. lib dem foreign affairs spokesman menzies campbell said the iraq war had hit trust in politicians hard. ""issues of war and peace, life and death do have a very damaging effect on the credibility of politicians"". martin bell, who won the tatton seat from tory neil hamilton on anti-corruption platform, said politicians often failed to see themselves as others did. ""we need public figures we trust to tell the truth and who can see themselves as others see them.""

internet giant yahoo has launched software to allow people to search e-mail and other files on their pcs.

the firm is following in the footsteps of microsoft, google and ask jeeves, which have offered similar services. search has become a lucrative and hotly-contested area of expansion for net firms, looking to extend loyalty beyond the web. with hard drives providing bigger storage, users could need more help to locate important files, such as photos.

the desktop search technology has been licensed from a us-based firm x1 technologies. it is designed to work alongside microsoft's outlook and outlook express e-mail programs. searching e-mail effectively is becoming increasingly important, especially as the amount of spam increases. according to research from message analysts the radicati group, up to 45% of businesses' critical information is stored in e-mail and attachments. yahoo's software can also work separately on the desktop, searching for music, photos and other files. users can search under a variety of criteria, including file name, size, date and time. it doesn't yet incorporate web searching, although yahoo has promised that future versions will allow users to search both web-based and desktop data. ""we are all getting more and more files on our desktop but the real commercial opportunity lies with linking this through to web content,"" said julian smith, an analyst with research firm jupiter. ""it is all about extending the idea of search and getting a closer relationship with consumers by organising not just how they search on the internet but the files on your computer as well,"" he said. search engines are often the first port of call for users when they go onto the web. the new foray into desktop search has rung alarm bells for human rights groups, concerned about the implications to privacy. and not everyone is impressed with the functionality of such services. alexander linden, vice president of emerging technologies at analyst firm gartner,downloaded the google product but has since removed it. ""it was just not very interesting,"" he said. he believes the rush to enter the desktop business is just a way of keeping up with rivals. ""desktop search is just one of many features people would like but i'm suspicious of its usefulness,"" he said. more useful would be tools that can combine internet, intranet and desktop search alongside improvements to key word searching, he said.

151,"will the budget bring out smiling voters?

as tory spokesman oliver letwin said - any chancellor would use his pre-election budget to offer some vote winning sweeteners, wouldn't he.

and everyone does, indeed, expect gordon brown to do just that in his last budget before the expected polling day of 5 may. there will be plenty of talk about taking no risks with the economy or handing out irresponsible giveaways. but mr brown will stun westminster and break just about every historical precedent if he fails to do something designed to put a smile on voters' faces and make them more inclined to back labour in the election. and there has already been speculation about possible tax reductions for the poorest and increasing the threshold on stamp duty in this week's budget. the aim of his package will be to keep any disillusioned core labour voters in the fold, while ensuring the middle england voters who gave tony blair two election victories don't desert him at the third poll.

and, needless to say, there will be plenty of analysis of what impact the budget will have on mr brown's own ambitions to replace mr blair as prime minister at some point after a third win. but there is a shadow hanging over this pre-election performance - in the shape of â£11 billion or thereabouts. that is the size of the financial ""black hole"" the tories, backed by some independent forecasters, believe mr brown will have to fill with tax increases after the election.

the opening shot in that battle was fired at the weekend with claims a treasury leak suggested mr brown was ready to slap capital gains tax on home sales to raise some of that cash. it was immediately denied, but the tories remain suspicious, claiming that, as mr letwin said, if the money does not come from there, where will it come from.

mr brown will undoubtedly claim the forecasts are simply wrong and that he will have absolutely no need to raise taxes after the election, should labour win. previous gloomy forecasts proved wrong, he will argue, while suggesting that only by sticking with him can britain continue to have a sound economy, low unemployment and high public spending. the opposition will reject that by claiming they can keep the economy sound, increase spending and cut taxes at the same time.

the liberal democrats will also promise to run a sound economy, but based on increased taxes to fund spending and, amongst other things, abolishing the council tax in favour of a local income tax. and there will be prolonged argument over which of the parties can make the greatest savings in whitehall and beyond to fund their policies. but probably what that all boils down to is a simple question of which of the parties the voters most trust to keep the economy stable and avoid any unpleasant surprises in the coming years. and it is probably still the answer to that one question that will overwhelmingly decide the outcome of the general election.

director oliver stone's historical epic alexander has failed in its bid to conquer the box office, entering the us film charts at number six.

the swords and sandals blockbuster, rumoured to have cost more than $150m (â£79m) to make, earned just $13.5 (â£7m) over three days at the us box office. due to the thanksgiving holiday, the film opened on wednesday, bringing its total takings to $21.6m (â£11.4m). top of the box office for a second week was action movie national treasure. the family adventure, starring nicolas cage, took $33.1m (â£17.m), ahead of animated comedy the incredibles - now in its fourth week in the charts - which took $24.1m (â£12.7m).

last week oliver stone's film met with scathing reviews from us critics. the film stars irish actor colin farrell as one of history's most celebrated leaders - a relentless and arrogant warrior who conquered much of the known world by the age of 25. in particular, its portrayal of alexander as a bisexual has met with a hostile reception and the threat of legal action from greek lawyers. ""though the battles have the blood-and-sinew bravado you expect from oliver stone, this three-hour buttnumbathon is hamstrung by a hectoring grandiosity,"" wrote one reviewer in rolling stone magazine. others poured scorn on farrell's bleached hair and angelina jolie's unwieldy accent, which variety called ""a combination of mata hari and count dracula"" . but novelist gore vidal defended the film, saying it was ""barrier-breaking"" for its frank depiction of bisexuality.

in sweden last thursday, to pick up a lifetime achievement award at the stockholm international film festival, stone expressed the hope that alexander might be better appreciated in europe.

shares in uk banking group barclays have risen on monday following a weekend press report that it had held merger talks with us bank wells fargo.

a tie-up between barclays and california-based wells fargo would create the world's fourth biggest bank, valued at $180bn (â£96bn). barclays has declined to comment on the report in the sunday express, saying it does not respond to market speculation. the two banks reportedly held talks in october and november 2004.

barclays shares were up 8 pence, or 1.3%, at 605 pence by late morning in london on monday, making it the second biggest gainer in the ftse 100 index. uk banking icon barclays was founded more than 300 years ago; it has operations in over 60 countries and employs 76,200 staff worldwide. its north american divisions focus on business banking, whereas wells fargo operates retail and business banking services from 6,000 branches. in 2003, barclays reported a 20% rise in pre-tax profits to â£3.8bn, and it has recently forecast similar gains in 2004, predicting that full year pre-tax profits would rise 18% to â£4.5bn. wells fargo had net income of $6.2bn in its last financial year, a 9% increase on the previous year, and revenues of $28.4bn. barclays was the focus of takeover speculation in august, when it was linked to citigroup, though no bid has ever materialised. stock market traders were sceptical that the latest reports heralded a deal.

australian brewer fosters has bought a large stake in australian winemaker southcorp, sparking rumours of a possible takeover.

fosters bought 18.8% of southcorp, the global winemaker behind the penfolds, lindemans and rosemount brands, for 4.17 australian dollars per share. a bid at that price would value the company at a$3.1bn ($2.4bn; â£1.25bn ). fosters said it was currently in discussions ""which may lead to a major corporate announcement"".

in a separate statement, southcorp confirmed the brewer had asked for talks. both firms asked the sydney stock market to suspend trading in their shares until monday. southcorp's shares were suspended at a$4.25.

fosters bought the 18.8% stake from reline investments, the family investment firm for the oatleys, who founded the rosemount estates label and sold it to southcorp in 2001. robert oatley and his son sandy oatley have both resigned from southcorp's board following the share deal. southcorp employs 2,700 people and is the largest single investor in rural australia, according to its website. the prospect of fosters launching a major acquisition startled investors, as the brewer said last summer that it was not looking to expand through a big buy in the near future. it has cash available, after getting a$846m from selling property business lensworth, but it has been widely expected to return cash to shareholders.

""people will scratching their heads over this one. fosters has done a back-flip"", said shawn burns, a fund manger at deutsche asset management. southcorp's shares have risen in recent months on speculation that it could become a takeover target. it spent two years in the red, returning to profit in 2004. consolidation in the wine industry is being driven by constellation, the world's biggest winemaker. it seized the top spot when it bought australian firm brl hardy for just over $1bn in 2003. since then, it has paid $1bn for us wine maker robert mondavi, bought last month. fosters' main wine business is beringer blass wine estate. its best known brand is fosters lager, though it makes a clutch of beer brands, and spirits. analysts were divided on thursday about whether fosters was more likely to go for a takeover or merely wanted to take a big enough chunk of southcorp to prevent it falling to a rival. ""currently, i think the strategic position is more sensible rather than an outright takeover,"" said one analyst quoted by the agence france presse news agency. however, matt williams, a fund manager at perpetual trustees said taking the stake ""is definitely a precursor to a takeover"".

the service, google video beta, searches closed caption information that comes with programmes. it only searches us channel content currently. results list programmes with still images and text from the point where the search phrase was spoken. it should expand over time to include content from more channels, said a google spokesperson. the first version of the service is part of google's expanding efforts to be a ubiquitous search engine for people to find what they want on the web and beyond. ""we think tv is a big part of people's lives,"" said jonathan rosenberg, google's vice president of product management. ""ultimately, we would like to have all tv programming indexed.""

google video has been indexing us-based programmes from pbs, the nba, fox news, and c-span since december. but there were few clues from google about when more global broadcasters would be included. ""over time, we plan to increase the number of television channels and video content available via google video but don't have more product details to share with you today,"" a google spokesperson told the bbc news website.

146,"child access laws shake-up

parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers. curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied, lord falconer said. the constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on tuesday. he denied fathers' activists had forced the changes, telling the bbc ""there is a recognition that something is wrong"". between 15,000 and 20,000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year, although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention.

lord falconer told bbc radio 4's today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. but he opposed compulsory mediation, saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. other plans include:


 - parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements, based on real-life examples that have worked in the past 
 - extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases 
 - better access to legal, emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet 
 - legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes. 
 

judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a ""nuclear option"" which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child's interests, a spokesman said. the aim of the new legislation was to provide a ""medium range"" of penalties, such as fines, community service orders, compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews.

failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged. on the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents, lord falconer said: ""tagging may be going too far, but let's have a debate about that."" full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published ""in the next two weeks,"" a spokesman said.

the government's proposals have met with disapproval from fathers' rights groups. john ison, from the controversial group fathers 4 justice, said: ""it is very disappointing. what we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation."" jim parton, from families need fathers, said the new proposals ""lacked compulsion"".

""we would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand, you know what the minimum access is. ""otherwise, you see people make agreements which then fall apart."" mr parton said he had been told by children's minister margaret hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election, which is likely to take place in may.

the conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law. theresa may, shadow secretary for the family, told bbc radio 4's today programme that the government's plans were ""inadequate"" and were ""papering over the cracks of the current system"". she said a conservative government would bring a ""radical reform"" of the family courts, as well as enforcing a ""legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation"". ""we want to make courts the last resort, rather than the first resort,"" she added. the government says children cannot simply be divided up ""like property"" when a marriage collapses. the liberal democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules, rather than having ""rigid targets"".

364,"profile: gordon brown

the ultimate prize of 10 downing street may continue to elude him but, as he prepares to deliver a record-breaking ninth budget, gordon brown can at least console himself with the thought that he is the longest serving chancellor of modern times.

he reached that milestone last june, when he overtook david lloyd george, who served for seven years and 43 days between 1908 and 1915. how much longer mr brown will continue in the job is not clear (he once said there are two types of chancellor: ""those who fail and those who get out in time."") there are rumours he will be moved to the foreign office if labour wins the general election. but, for now, mr brown dominates the domestic political scene like few chancellors - or politicians - before him.

gordon brown was born in glasgow on 20 february 1951, the son of a church of scotland minister in the small fife town of kirkcaldy. at 12, he was canvassing for labour and by his 20s he was a leading political activist in scotland. he achieved a first class degree in history from edinburgh university, where he went on to complete a phd. his early career was spent lecturing, working in television and making a name for himself in the scottish labour party.

his first attempt to enter westminster, for edinburgh south in 1979, was thwarted by the present tory spokesman on foreign affairs, michael ancram. but in 1983, he took dunfermline east, a new constituency including rosyth naval base, pit villages and coastal towns.

entering westminster, he came to share an office with the newly elected mp for sedgefield, tony blair. within four years, mr brown had gained his first frontbench post as shadow chief secretary to the treasury. he became shadow chancellor under john smith's leadership in 1992. after the death of leader john smith in 1994 he stood aside, agreeing to give tony blair a clear run at the leadership during a now infamous meal at the granita restaurant in islington.

the other part of the deal, that mr blair will one day stand down in favour of the chancellor, is the stuff of westminster legend. mr blair's supporters say such a deal never existed and endless newspaper columns - and even a television film - have been devoted to the alleged deal. but if his leadership ambitions were at least temporarily thwarted in 1994, mr brown continued his devotion to politics. during the 1997 election campaign, he is said to have worked an average of 18 hours a day, six days a week after running on a treadmill for an hour each morning.

this dedication to his career was underlined by a comment by mr brown's former girlfriend of five years, princess marguerite of romania, the eldest daughter of ex-king michael of romania, who said a relationship with him was ""politics, politics, politics"".

if that was true then, mr brown, who married pr executive sarah macaulay in 2000, changed his perspective when the couple were hit by tragedy early in 2002. their daughter jennifer died in edinburgh royal infirmary, 10 days after being born seven weeks prematurely. a year later, in october 2003, the couple had a son - john - an event which again gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his softer side. a trip to africa earlier this year, to publicise his scheme to cancel the debt of poor nations, also gave the chancellor an opportunity to show his more human side.

the ideological differences between mr brown and mr blair remain relatively modest. the chancellor opposes the further encroachment of the market into the nhs and is seen as being more ""old labour"" than mr blair in his approach to wealth redistribution. but their shared belief that market economics are compatible with social justice continues to form the ideological heart of the new labour project. yet they are portrayed by the media as being locked in almost permanent conflict, with mr brown supposedly nursing resentment at being betrayed by his younger downing street neighbour over the succession. mr blair, for his part, is said to be frustrated that his public service reforms are being thwarted by a vengeful mr brown, who reportedly delights in keeping the prime minister in the dark over the contents of his budget until the last possible minute. after a recent run of negative headlines, labour mps took the unprecedented step of making a direct appeal to the two men stop bickering, for the good of the party. events like this, and the testimony of former ministerial colleagues, make it impossible to dismiss the brown/blair feud as just journalistic hearsay, cooked up by hacks and camp followers in the hothouse atmosphere of westminster. how much it damages the ability of government to do its job is open to question.

a truce appears to have been called in the run up to the general election after a fresh spat was sparked by blairite alan milburn being brought in over the head of mr brown to run the election campaign. but with the tories having appeared to get the better of the pre-election campaign thus far there are reports that mr brown - using the budget as a springboard - is to revitalise labour's campaign. amid all this it is easy to forget that mr brown remains the man most likely to succeed mr blair as labour leader. there may be no shortage of possible contenders for the crown - including mr milburn - but none can command the sort of support in the parliamentary party and beyond that mr brown can. and mr blair's decision to name his own retirement date has at least given mr brown something to aim for - even if the prime minister's intention to ""serve a full third term"" if elected, took the shine off the announcement for the chancellor and his supporters.

a major change of direction is needed in britain if it is to prosper, the shadow chancellor said as the tory party spring conference began.

oliver letwin said the uk could not compete with other countries without the â£4bn tax cuts he was promising. tory co-chairman liam fox had opened the forum in brighton with an attack on labour's record and party leader michael howard is due to speak later. tony blair has said conservative policies would cause economic failure. but mr letwin said britain had fallen from fourth to 11th in the international economic competitiveness league.

""can this country compete, can this country prosper, unless we do something about the burden of regulation and tax on our economy?"" he said. ""if we are going to take on the great challenges, the challenges like those posed by the chinese and the indians, we have got to do something about getting down the burden of regulation and getting down the burden of tax,"" he said. ""the fact is the very carefully costed, fully funded plans we have laid out for saving â£12bn by 2007-2008 are absolutely crucial to delivering an economy that will prosper and provide people with jobs and indeed provide the public services with the money they need on a sustainable long-term basis."" mr letwin said voting for labour meant choosing higher taxes, borrowing and waste.

earlier, dr fox had said labour's rule had been characterised by ""lost trust and failure to deliver"". he also attacked the government's ""failure"" to control immigration and asylum and criticised its record on the nhs, telling delegates labour cannot be trusted on education or crime. a tory government would sort out the ""shambles"" of immigration, put patients before statistics and bring discipline to schools, he said. michael howard, who had been due to welcome delegates to the conference on friday, will address them in a lunchtime speech. his welcome address had to be postponed after he stayed in london to lead the party's opposition to the prevention of terrorism bill in its lengthy progress through parliament. the bill was finally passed on friday evening, after more than 30 hours of debate. mr howard is likely to defend his party's handling of the bill, which was only passed after the conservatives accepted prime minister tony blair's promise that mps would be able to review it within a year.

1751,"golden rule boost for chancellor

chancellor gordon brown has been given a â£2.1bn boost in his attempts to meet his golden economic rule, which allows him to borrow only for investment.

the extra leeway came after the office for national statistics said it had been measuring road expenditure data wrongly over the past five years. it comes just weeks ahead of the budget and an expected general election. shadow chancellor oliver letwin said: ""at best the timing of these changes is very convenient for the government.""

a review by the ons found it had made a mistake by ""double counting"" some spending on roads since 1998/9. correcting the error would mean reducing current expenditure and increasing net investment, thus helping mr brown to meet his ""golden rule"" of borrowing only to invest over the economic cycle. economists speculated that it might also allow for some vote-catching measures in the budget.

the changes by the ons increase the current budget measure for the past five years by â£2.1bn in total. mr letwin said: ""this is a very murky area... there will inevitably be suspicions that the figures are being fiddled."" the conservatives also said mr brown would still be forced to raise taxes after the general election to fill an annual â£10.5bn ""black hole"" in the nation's coffers. but the treasury said there would be no relaxation of economic discipline and the golden rule would be met even without the data revisions.

in january the independent institute for fiscal studies (ifs) said mr brown would need to raise taxes to get public finances onto the track predicted in last year's budget. it also said the government might narrowly miss its ""golden rule"" if the current economic cycle ended in 2005/06. after the ons announcement, economists said there could also be a proportionate boost to the current budget in 2004/05 of about â£400m. ""none of this changes the big picture of a dramatic deterioration in the overall fiscal position over the last four or five years,"" said jonathan loynes, chief uk economist at capital economics. ""accordingly, it seems very likely that some form of fiscal consolidation will be required in due course.""

1857,"building giant in asbestos payout

australian building products group james hardie has agreed to pay $1.1bn (â£568m) to victims of asbestos-related diseases.

the landmark deal could see thousands of people suffering from lung diseases - caused by asbestos the company once made - receive compensation. the move follows angry protests after the firm said a previous compensation fund was running out of money. a subsequent new south wales state inquiry criticised hardie's actions. in september, the inquiry found that the company had misled the public about the amount of money set aside to cover its asbestos-related liabilities, sparking the resignation of its then chief executive, peter macdonald.

campaigners welcomed news of the preliminary agreement. ""this is a momentous day in the fight for victims and their families,"" said asbestosis sufferer bernie banton, who leads a victims' association. ""there is still a long way to go, but we are getting there."" james hardie chairwoman, meredith hellicar, said the deal provided for a funding arrangement ""that is affordable, sensible and workable"".

991,"europe backs digital tv lifestyle

how people receive their digital entertainment in the future could change, following the launch of an ambitious european project.

in nice last week, the european commission announced its networked & electronic media (nem) initiative. its broad scope stretches from the way media is created, through each of the stages of its distribution, to its playback. the commission wants people to be able to locate the content they desire and have it delivered seamlessly, when on the move, at home or at work, no matter who supplies the devices, network, content, or content protection scheme. more than 120 experts were in nice to share the vision of interconnected future and hear pledges of support from companies such as nokia, intel, philips, alcatel, france telecom, thomson and telefonica. it might initially appear to be surprising that companies in direct competition are keen to work together. but again and again, speakers stated they could not see incompatible, stand-alone solutions working. a long-term strategy for the evolution and convergence of technologies and services would be required.

the european commission is being pragmatic in its approach. they have identified that many groups have defined the forms of digital media in the areas that nem encompasses. the nem approach is to take a serious look at what is available and what is in the pipeline, pick out the best, bring them together and identify where the gaps are. where it finds holes, it will develop standards to fill them. what is significant is that such a large and powerful organisation has stated its desire for digital formats to be open to all and work on any gadget. this is bound to please, if not surprise, many individuals and user organisations who feel that the wishes of the holder of rights to content are normally considered over and above those of the consumer. many feel that the most difficult and challenging area for the commission will be to identify a solution for different digital rights management (drm) schemes. currently drm solutions are incompatible, locking certain types of purchased content, making them unplayable on all platforms. with the potential of having a percentage of every media transaction that takes place globally, the prize for being the supplier of the world's dominant drm scheme is huge. although entertainment is an obvious first step, it will encompass the remote provisions of healthcare, energy efficiency and control of the smart home. the 10-year plan brings together the work of many currently running research projects that the ec has been funding for a number of years.

2131,"euro firms miss out on optimism

more than 90% of large companies around the world are highly optimistic about their economic prospects, a survey of 1,300 bosses suggests.

their biggest worries are not terror threats, but over-regulation, low-cost competition and the wild ups and downs of oil prices. there is one exception: firms in western europe - but not the uk - are lacking confidence after years of slow growth. when business advisers pricewaterhousecoopers (pwc) conducted the same survey two years ago, nearly 30% of bosses were gloomy about their prospects.

global business leaders say that they are facing a two-pronged regulatory assault. after a string of corporate scandals in the united states - from enron to worldcom - the sarbanes-oxley act forces companies to be much more transparent, but doing all the paperwork costs a lot of time and money. across europe, meanwhile, all stock exchange-listed companies are currently in the process of moving to new and complex accounting standards called ifrs. hacking through the red tape can hardly be avoided, but many chief executives around the world appear to have decided on how to deal with low-cost competitors.

already, about 28% of the bosses polled for the survey say that they have moved parts of their business into low-wage countries, and another 11% plan to do so in the future. possibly as a result, the worry about low-cost competition has slightly fallen from last year, with just 54% of companies calling it a ""significant threat"" or ""one of the biggest threats"". but pwc's global chief executive, samuel dipiazza, said a growing number of companies were also concerned that moves to outsource work to cheaper countries could both hurt their reputation in their home markets and harm the quality of service they provide to their customers.

according to frank brown, global advisory leader at pwc , the trend of large companies to have global operations has one clear upside: ""one risk in one region - for example the middle east - won't kill your business anymore."" surprisingly, the survey suggests that the rapid decline of the us dollar is not seen as a huge threat anymore, unlike even a year ago, when it was cited as the third-largest problem. mr dipiazza said the interviews with chief executives suggested that companies had ""adjusted"" to the new reality of a euro that buys $1.30 and more, while others had successfully hedged their positions and locked in more favourable exchange rates.


 - for the survey, pricewaterhousecoopers interviewed 1,324 chief executives throughout the world during the last three months of 2004.

2142,"axa sun life cuts bonus payments

life insurer axa sun life has lowered annual bonus payouts for up to 50,000 with-profits investors.

regular annual bonus rates on former axa equity & law with-profits policies are to be cut from 2% to 1% for 2004. axa blamed a poor stock market performance for the cut, adding that recent gains have not yet offset the market falls seen in 2001 and 2002. the cut will hit an estimated 3% of axa's policyholders. the rest will know their fate in march.

the cuts on axa's policies will mean a policyholder who had invested â£50 a month into an endowment policy for the past 25 years would see a final maturity payout of â£46,998. this equated to a annual investment growth rate of 8% axa said. with-profits policies are designed to smooth out the peaks and troughs of stock market volatility. however, heavy stock market falls throughout 2001 and 2002 forced most firms to trim bonus rates on their policies.

291,"minimum rate for foster parents

foster carers are to be guaranteed a minimum allowance to help cover their costs, the government has announced.

payment levels vary from area to area, with some carers getting just â£50 a week for clothes, food and other costs. minister for children, young people and families margaret hodge said new plans will ensure fosterers' allowances would be as fair as possible. however local authorities, which set and pay the allowances, are concerned about how the extra cash will be found. about 50,000 children live with foster families in the uk and carers have said they need more money to make ends meet.

ms hodge said: ""foster carers must not be out of pocket when meeting the costs of caring for a looked after child - a crucial role in society. ""we need to make sure that arrangements for paying foster carers are as fair and transparent as possible. ""our proposal for a national minimum rate shows we are serious about creating a better deal for foster carers and about encouraging more people to come forward and consider fostering as a worthwhile and rewarding opportunity."" the government is seeking to amend the children bill, which passes through the commons next week, to establish a national minimum payment.

fostering network executive director robert tapsfield criticised the existing system. ""there is just no logic to a system which values children differently depending on where they live. ""and with a shortage of over 8,000 foster carers in england, it's not a sustainable situation to expect carers to fund foster care from their own pockets."" the charity recommends a weekly payment of â£108.49 for looking after a baby. in a survey, it discovered that rates paid by neighbouring authorities could vary by as much as â£100 per week.

the association of directors of social services (adss) said it agreed in principle with the government's plans. tony hunter, the organisation's president, said: ""there are many devils and lots of details hidden within the government's proposals. ""but adss fully supports proper remuneration for valued foster carers and looks forward to working with ministers, local government and the fostering organisations themselves in order to make sure a sensible and practicable policy emerges.""

1003,"games win for blu-ray dvd format

the next-generation dvd format blu-ray is winning more supporters than its rival, according to its backers.

blu-ray, backed by 100 firms including sony, is competing against toshiba and nec-backed hd-dvd to be the format of choice for future films and games. the blu-ray association said on thursday that games giants electronic arts and vivendi would both support its dvd format. the next generation of dvds will hold high-definition video and sound. this offers incredible 3d-like quality of pictures which major hollywood studios and games publishers are extremely keen to exploit in the coming year. in a separate press conference at the consumer electronics show in las vegas, toshiba announced that dvd players for its technology would be on the market by the end of 2005.

""as we move from standard definition video images to high-definition images, we have a much greater need for storage,"" richard doherty, from panasonic's hollywood laboratories, one of the pioneers of blu-ray, told the bbc news website. ""so by utilising blue laser-based technology we can make an optical laser disc that can hold six times as much as today's dvd."" a blu-ray disc will be able to store 50gb of high-quality data, while toshiba's hd-dvd will hold 30gb. mr doherty added that it was making sure the discs could satisfy all high-definition needs, including the ability to record onto the dvds and smaller discs to fit into camcorders. both toshiba and blu-ray are hopeful that the emerging dvd format war, akin to the betamax and vhs fight in the 1980s, can be resolved over the next year when next-generation dvd players start to come out. when players do come out, they will be able to play standard dvds too, which is good news for those who have huge libraries of current dvds.

but the support from vivendi and electronics arts is a big boost to blu-ray in the battle for supremacy.

gaming is a $20 billion industry worldwide, so is as crucial as the film industry in terms of money to be made. ""the technical requirement for game development today demands more advanced optical-disc technologies,"" said michael heilmann, chief technology officer for vivendi universal. ""blu-ray offers the capacity, performance and high-speed internet connectivity to take us into the future of gaming."" ea, a leading games developer and publisher, added that the delivery of high-definition games of the future was vital and blu-ray had the capacity, functionality and interactivity needed for the kinds of projects it was planning. sony recently announced it would be using the technology in its next generation of playstations. mr doherty said gamers were ""ravenous"" for high-quality graphics and technology for the next generation of titles. ""gamers, especially those working on pcs, are always focused on more capacity to deliver textures, deeper levels, for delivering higher-resolution playback.""

he added: ""the focus for games moving forward on increased immersion.

""gaming companies really like to focus on creating a world which involves creating complicated 3d models and textures and increasing the resolution, increasing the frame rate - all of these are part of getting a more immersive experience."" fitting these models on current dvd technologies means compressing the graphics so much that much of this quality is lost. as games move to more photo-real capability, the current technology is limiting. ""they are thrilled at the advanced capacity to start to build these immersive environments,"" said mr doherty. currently, graphics-intensive pc games also require multiple discs for installation. high-definition dvds will cut down on that need. likewise, consoles rely on single discs, so dvds that can hold six times more data mean much better, high-resolution games. blu-ray has already won backing from major hollywood studios, such as mgm studios, disney, and buena vista, as well as top technology firms like dell, lg, samsung and phillips amongst others. while toshiba's hd-dvd technology has won backing from paramount, universal and warner bros. ""the real world benefits (of hd-dvd) are apparent and obvious,"" said jim cardwell, president of warner home video. mr cardwell added that rapid time to market and dependability were significant factors in choosing to go with hd-dvd. both formats are courting microsoft to be the format of choice for the next generation xbox, but discussions are still on-going. next generation dvds will also be able to store images and other data. ces is the largest consumer electronics show in the world, and runs from 6 to 9 january.

1274,"when invention turns to innovation

it is unlikely that future technological inventions are going to have the same kind of transformative impact that they did in the past.

when history takes a look back at great inventions like the car and transistor, they were defining technologies which ultimately changed people's lives substantially. but, says nick donofrio, senior vice-president of technology and manufacturing at ibm, it was not ""the thing"" itself that actually improved people's lives. it was all the social and cultural changes that the discovery or invention brought with it. the car brought about a crucial change to how people lived in cities, giving them the ability to move out into the suburbs, whilst having mobility and access. ""when we talk about innovation and creating real value in the 21st century, we have to think more like this, but faster,"" mr donofrio told the bbc news website, after giving the royal academy of engineering 2004 hinton lecture. ""the invention, discovery is likely not to have the same value as the transistor had or the automobile had. ""the equivalent of those things will be invented or discovered, but by themselves, they are just not going to able to generate real business value or wealth as these things did."" these are not altogether new ideas, and academics have been exploring how technologies impact wider society for years. but what it means for technology companies is that a new idea, method, or device, will have to have a different kind thinking behind it so that people see the value that innovative technology has for them.

we are in a different phase now when it comes to technology, argues mr donofrio, industry week's 2003 technology leader of the year. the hype and over-promise is over and now technology leaders have to demonstrate that things work, make sense, make a difference and life gets better as a result.

""in the dotcom era, there was something that was jumping up in your face every five minutes. ""somebody had a new thing that would awe you. you weren't quite sure that it did anything, you weren't quite sure if you needed it, you weren't quite sure if it had value for it, but it was cool."" but change and innovation in technology that people will see affecting their daily lives, he says, will come about slowly, subtlety, and in ways that will no longer be ""in your face"". it will creep in pervasively. nanotechnologies will play a key part in this kind of pervasive environment in all sorts of ways, through new superconducting materials, to coatings, power, and memory storage. ""i am a very big believer in the evolution of this industry into a pervasive environment, in an incredible network infrastructure,"" says mr donofrio. pervasive computing is where wireless computing rules, and where jewellery, clothes, and everyday objects become the interfaces instead of bulky wires, screens and keyboards. the net becomes a true network that is taken for granted and just there, like air. ""people will not have to do anything to stay connected. people will know their lives are just better,"" says mr donofrio. ""trillions of devices will be connected to the net in ways people will not know."" natural interfaces will develop, devices will shape your persona, and our technologically underused voices could be telling our jewellery to sort out the finances.

ultimately, there will be, says mr donofrio, no value in being ""computer illiterate"". to some, it sounds like a technological world gone mad. to mr donofrio, it is a vision innovation that will happen. behind this vision should be a rich robust network capability and ""deep computing"", says mr donofrio. deep computing is the ability to perform lots of complex calculations on massive amounts of data, and integral to this concept is supercomputing. it has value, according to ibm, because it helps humans work out extremely complex problems to come up with valuable solutions, like how to refine millions of net search results, finding cures for diseases, or understanding of exactly how a gene or protein operates.

but pervasive computing presumably means having technologies that are aware of diversity of contexts, commands, and requirements of a diverse world. as computing and technologies become part of the environment, part of furniture, walls, and clothing, physical space becomes a more important consideration.

this is going to need a much broader range of skills and experience. ""i am confident that the set [science, engineering and technology] industry is going to be short on skills,"" he says. ""if i am right about what innovation is, you need to be multidisciplinary and collaborative. ""women tend to have those traits a lot better than men."" eventually, women could win out in both life and physical sciences, he says. in the uk, a dti-funded resource centre for women has set a target to have 40% representation on set industry boards. ibm, according to mr donofrio, has 30%. ""our goal is for our research team to become the preferred organisation for women in science and technology to begin their career."" the whole issue of global diversity is as much a business matter as it is a moral and social concern to mr donofrio. ""we believe in the whole issue of global diversity,"" he says. ""our customers are diverse, our clients are diverse. they expect us to look like them. ""as more and more women or underrepresented minorities succeed into leadership positions, it becomes and imperative for us to constantly look like them.""

1915,"could yukos be a blessing in disguise?

other things being equal, the notion of entrepreneurs languishing in jail while their companies are sold off for a song ought to be bad for business.

but in the looking-glass world of modern russia, the opposite might just be true, a new report* has argued. the study, from the centre for economic policy research, does not praise the rough handling of oil company yukos. but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms, even targets of the tax police. ""an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation,"" the authors say.

the paper's reasoning is complex, and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular, the propensity of management to steal from the company. the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal, since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable. in the west, meanwhile, higher tax rates translate far more smoothly into higher government revenues. on the other hand, increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent, forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately. the net result, the authors say, is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.

after vladimir putin became president in 2000, he did not raise taxes, but put a lot of effort - too much, critics argue - into enforcement.

since then, the russian stock market has more than trebled in value, a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach. the report highlights the case of sibneft, a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year. after mr putin came to power, the company's overall effective tax rate rose from 2.6% to 10.4%, and sibneft was the target of a series of aggressive raids by fiscal police. but shareholders benefited hugely: sibneft started to pay dividends - $53m in 2000 and almost $1bn in 2001 - and closed down the network of opaque subsidiaries it had previously used for siphoning off unofficial funds. according to the authors, although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time, the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers.

does this analysis make sense? in part, certainly. for all its faults, corporate russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000. companies have rushed to list their shares on international stock exchanges - something unthinkable in the wilder days of the 1990s - and most large firms now produce their accounts to international standards. foreign direct investment, long negligible, is starting to flow in serious amounts - $7bn in 2003 - and stock market returns have been among the healthiest in europe. but the authors' model does not quite cover all the complexities. for a start, the model assumes that the various parties have clearly-defined motivation: companies want to maximise profit, governments want to maximise tax revenue. in fact, the alarmingly close connections between big business and government in russia - connections often greased by bribery - blur the apparently antagonistic relationship. companies can, for example, persuade officials to overlook non-payment of taxes.

and the authors' definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western. genuine, disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced. the case against yukos, for example, has moved in fits and starts, with little clarity from the government about its intentions, and little faith from investors that the letter of the law would be followed. as far as most commentators are concerned, the state is pursuing yukos out of a political vendetta, rather than simply to enforce fiscal rectitude. since yukos' founder, mikhail khodorkovsky, was arrested a year ago, the russian market has dropped by 10% - an indication that few investors feel optimistic about the salutary effect on corporate performance.
","but it argues that more rigorous tax policing has benefited all russian firms, even targets of the tax police.the calculations demonstrated what many russian analysts already knew: that increasing the tax rate increases the amount that managers steal, since undeclared income becomes relatively more valuable.the net result, the authors say, is that the extra amount companies pay in tax is more than compensated for by greater efficiency and financial soundness.since then, the russian stock market has more than trebled in value, a rise the authors attribute at least in part to the newly tough approach.the report highlights the case of sibneft, a russian oil company that came close to merging with yukos last year.""an increase in tax enforcement can increase the amount [of dividends and other income] outside shareholders will receive, even accounting for increased levels of taxation,"" the authors say.according to the authors, although a variety of changes were sweeping through russian industry at the time, the increase in tax enforcement is the only likely explanation for the change of fortunes at sibneft and many of its peers.genuine, disinterested tax collection might well work wonders in russia; the problem with recent examples has been the erratic and unpredictable way laws are enforced.and the authors' definition of tax enforcement seems unrealistically western.the paper's reasoning is complex, and is based on a sophisticated model of the relationship between tax regimes and corporate governance - in particular, the propensity of management to steal from the company.on the other hand, increasing the rigour with which taxes are collected encourages companies to become more transparent, forcing them to be able to demonstrate their financial position far more accurately.for all its faults, corporate russia has become far more orderly and law-abiding since 2000.",business,709,288

162,"peers debate crown succession law

peers are debating proposals to change the rules governing the succession to the throne.

labour peer lord dubs' succession to the crown bill aims to end the right of male heirs to succeed to the crown even if they have an older sister. the private member's bill would also abolish the ban on heirs to the throne marrying roman catholics. the fabian society's sundar katwala said the change was ""long overdue"" and that he expected a ""warm response"". the political reform group's general secretary told bbc radio 4's today programme there were some ""very out-dated features"" at the heart of britain's constitution.

""in 1998 the government said in principle it supported the idea of ending gender discrimination and that it would consult on how to come forward with its own measures. ""we hope they are warm towards it and don't say this is the wrong time."" he pointed out that it was 30 years since the sex discrimination act and urged politicians on all sides to back the bill. mr katwala added: ""this is long overdue. parliament will have to do it eventually, the government, and i hope all of the political parties, might think this is a very simple thing to have in their manifestos.""

but he acknowledged that even if the bill did win support, it was unlikely to become law because the legislative programme is likely to be squeezed by the coming general election. he said he hoped the bill would be a ""gentle nudge"" to the government and suggested it would ""demand a response"". the bill, which is in the lords for its second reading, has been adopted by former chief whip ann taylor in the commons. the rule of succession is regulated not only through descent and tradition but also by the act of settlement which confirmed in 1701 that it was for parliament to determine the title to the throne.
